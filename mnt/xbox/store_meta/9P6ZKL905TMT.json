  "description": "Be the architect of your own universe with Spore, an exciting single-player adventure available for download to your PC. Will you be a bloodthirsty carnivore destined to crush your competitors, or a gentle herbivore seeking out stronger allies to enforce your quiet way of life?\r\n\r\nExperience unparalleled dangers as you hunt for food and struggle to evolve in this thrilling game of strategy and survival. You’ll lay the groundwork for your creature’s future in the Creature design stage of the game: the evolution interface allows you to choose every aspect of your race’s physical shape as well as its social bent and mission in life.\r\n\r\nThen the real work begins, as you move from basest animalistic needs to those of a social creature with tribes — and eventually a civilization. The choices your tribe makes will align you with one of three social paths for your subjects: religious, commerce, and war-mongering. These decisions will lead your civilization into the far reaches of space, where you must struggle to colonize new planets as other races try to destroy you.\r\n\r\nShare your creations with your friends at the online Spore site, where you can browse the community and download everything from creatures to spaceships. The more you share, the more unique your worlds will become. Exchange your creations with millions of other players, and marvel at a world of your own making.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE EA.COM/LEGAL FOR DETAILS.",
