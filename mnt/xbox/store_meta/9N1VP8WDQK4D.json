  "description": "Rise to the challenge and join the hunt! In Monster Hunter Rise, the latest installment in the award-winning and top-selling Monster Hunter series, you’ll become a hunter, explore brand new maps and use a variety of weapons to take down fearsome monsters as part of an all-new storyline. \r\n\r\nFerocious monsters with unique ecologies\r\nHunt down a plethora of monsters with distinct behaviors and deadly ferocity. From classic returning monsters to all-new creatures inspired by Japanese folklore, including the flagship wyvern Magnamalo, you’ll need to think on your feet and master their unique tendencies if you hope to reap any of the rewards!\r\n\r\nChoose your weapon and show your skills\r\nWield 14 different weapon types that offer unique gameplay styles, both up-close and from long range. Charge up and hit hard with the devastating Great Sword; dispatch monsters in style using the elegant Long Sword; become a deadly maelstrom of blades with the speedy Dual Blades; charge forth with the punishing Lance; or take aim from a distance with the Bow and Bowguns. These are just a few of the weapon types available in the game, meaning you’re sure to find the play style that suits you best. \r\n\r\nHunt, gather and craft your way to the top of the food chain\r\nEach monster you hunt will provide materials that allow you to craft new weapons and armor and upgrade your existing gear. Go back out on the field and hunt even fiercer monsters and earn even better rewards! You can change your weapon at any of the Equipment Boxes any time, so the possibilities are limitless!\r\n\r\nHunt solo or team up to take monsters down\r\nThe Hunter Hub offers multiplayer quests where up to four players can team up to take on targets together. Difficulty scaling ensures that whether you go solo or hit the hunt as a full four-person squad, it’s always a fair fight.\r\n\r\nEnjoy an exciting new storyline set in Kamura Village\r\nThis serene locale is inhabited by a colorful cast of villagers who have long lived in fear of the Rampage - a catastrophic event where countless monsters attack the village all at once. 50 years after the last Rampage, you must work together with the villagers to face this trial.\r\n\r\nExperience new hunting actions with the Wirebug\r\nWirebugs are an integral part of your hunter’s toolkit. The special silk they shoot out can be used to zip up walls and across maps, and can even be used to pull off special attacks unique to each of the 14 weapon types in the game.\r\n\r\nBuddies are here to help \r\nThe Palico Felyne friends you already know and love from previous Monster Hunter adventures are joined by the brand new Palamute Canyne companions!\r\n\r\nWreak havoc by controlling monsters\r\nControl raging monsters using Wyvern Riding and dish out massive damage to your targets! \r\n\r\nFend off hordes of monsters in The Rampage\r\nProtect Kamura Village from hordes of monsters in an all-new quest type! Prepare for monster hunting on a scale like never before!\r\n\r\n*This content is also available as part of one or more bundles.
