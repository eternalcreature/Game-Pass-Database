In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and  your weapons to face untold horrors, untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself.\r\n\r\n・ A DARKLY ELEGANT AND CRUEL WORLD\r\nUnearth the secrets of the city of Krat – a place soaked in the style of the Belle Epoque era which once thrived due to its puppet industry and now sees its streets covered in blood.\r\n\r\n・BATTLE WITH TWISTED INSTRUMENTS\r\nDevelop a unique combat style to counter vicious enemies and terrain by weaving together dynamic weapon combinations, utilizing the Legion Arms, and activating new abilities.\r\n\r\n・WHAT’S IN A LIE?\r\nThere will be times when you will be confronted with choices where you can give comfort to others in sorrow or despair by lying…or you can choose to tell the truth. \r\n\r\nCarve your own path.\r\n\r\n・A CLASSIC REIMAGINED\r\nExperience the beloved fairy tale of Pinocchio reinterpreted as a dark, grim narrative that allows players to discover the secrets and symbols hidden within the world of Lies of P.",
