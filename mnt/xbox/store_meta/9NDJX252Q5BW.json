  "description": "The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S with the full release of the game.\n\nThis game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nWILL IS BACK IN BUSINESS!\nDive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around.\n\nFORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD\nProfitable perils await, so strap on your trusty backpack and dive right in. Trust your adventurer instincts to plot a clever route, then carefully arrange your loot to maximize profits. Remember: the further you delve, the greater the rewards. How far will you dare to go?\n\nMONEY NEVER SLEEPS\nAfter each escapade, you put your hard-earned loot on sale. That’s where your shop-owner charm will shine. Deck out the shop, read your customers, and set your own price to score the perfect deal. Cash in on special events while unlocking perks to build sales momentum. Battered scrap or shiny relic, their value isn’t fixed; it’s decided by you!\n\nTOWARDS PROSPERITY\nA merchant can only be as prosperous as their own village. Invest in the townsfolk’s establishments to obtain better weapons, armors and upgrades. As the village thrives and grows more vibrant, new people (and money!) will be drawn towards your shop.\n\nTHE ENDLESS VAULT\nFace the challenge of the Endless Vault, an ancient artifact that tests merchants' skills to their limits.  Conquer the Vault's trials to upgrade your town, and continuously raise the stakes for even greater rewards.",
