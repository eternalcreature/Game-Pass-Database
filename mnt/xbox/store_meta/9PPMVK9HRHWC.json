  "description": "Unrivalled simulation gaming. No game gets you closer to the dream of managing the world’s best football teams. \r\nFM21 is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but, unlike other games, there’s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it’s up to you to write it.\r\nChoose the club and the challenge that best suits your ambitions. There are more than 2,000 playable clubs from 50+ top footballing nations to pick from to start your journey. The choice is in your hands. \r\nWith a database featuring more than 500,000 real life players and staff, your scouting team will find players to help make your squad better. There's also likely to be a prospect or two in the youth team knocking on the door of the first team. Can you develop their skills and turn them into a world-beater?\r\nCraft tactical strategies, formations and play styles for every occasion to maximise your club’s chances of winning football matches and trophies. Fast-track your success with popular tactics from the real world of football or develop your own unique style.\r\nImmerse yourself in the spectacle of matchday and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch before your very eyes. You can almost taste the victory.\r\nNEW FOR THIS SEASON\r\nStamp Your Style\r\nCommunicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express yourself more clearly, while Quick Chats improve the short conversations part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are.\r\nMatchday Magic\r\nEvery fixture is now a true spectacle. You’ll now receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up as well as more reaction and data post-match. You’ll benefit from our brand new xG system, which illustrates how well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created. Those data improvements combine with a remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action.\r\nBoss The Market\r\nNew staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game’s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for the short- and long-term. You’ll also now be able to approach agents directly about a player's interest in joining your club, mimicking how deals are done in the real footballing world. \r\nRevel In Your Glory\r\nRe-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review experience picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention.",
