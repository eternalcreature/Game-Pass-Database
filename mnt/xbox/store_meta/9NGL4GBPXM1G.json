  "description": "Discover your dark side as you build an evil underground kingdom and defend it against the forces of good. Carve out a living, breathing world and attract a host of devilish creatures to swell the ranks of your dark hordes. Form an alliance with the Horned Reaper to expand your empire and invade the realms above. In this dungeon-building, treasure-defending, hero-destroying adventure, it feels good to be bad - and the badder the better!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet your hands on even more evil tools. Use everything at your disposal – torture devices included - to create the deadliest dungeon imaginable. Set traps, send dastardly demons to do your bidding and unleash the powers of the underworld with a brand new magic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule your way. Keep your minions well-supplied with bustling infrastructure and good pay, or scare them into miserable servitude. There’s no extra credit for good behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBring your friends to their knees. Play with up to four frenemies and prove who’s the most ruthless dungeon keeper in all land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE EA.COM/LEGAL FOR DETAILS.",
