  "description": "Part human, part demon, and obsessed with vengeance. Become The Unknown, and fight through the fiercest domains of Hell. Destroy the demon hordes and their leaders to set yourself up for an epic showdown with The Red Judge herself.\r\n\r\nEvery legend has a song. And yours is one of metal, vengeance, and destruction.\r\n\r\nSlay to the beat\r\nMetal: Hellsinger is a rhythm FPS, where your ability to shoot on the beat will enhance your gameplay experience. The more in sync you are with the rhythm, the more intense the music will become and the more destruction you will cause.\r\n\r\nDemonic arsenal\r\nDefeat the demon hordes with a skull-clad blade or a wide range of murderous guns. Each weapon has its own ultimate ability, such as Murder of Crows or The Big Goodbye.\r\n\r\nEpic story and Challenge Mode\r\nPlay through an epic storyline, narrated by award-winning actor Troy Baker. Unlock special challenges and conquer the realms of Torment to become more powerful in the stages and get a leg up on the leaderboards.\r\n\r\nFight through fire, ice, metal and madness\r\nAlthough commonly known as Hell, The Infernal Planes is in reality a union of a thousand Hells, all of which are terrifying and diabolical in their own way. In order to dethrone The Red Judge, you must fight your way through the fiercest corners, from the icy world of Voke to the maddening world of Stygia.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lead Designer of Battlefield: Bad Company 2\r\nMetal: Hellsinger is created by an experienced FPS team at The Outsiders and is the passion project of David Goldfarb, Game Director on Payday 2 and Lead Designer on Battlefield 3 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2.\r\n\r\nOriginal metal soundtrack\r\nEvery track has been created specifically for the game by composer duo Two Feathers, with vocals by metal icons such as Serj Tankian (System of a Down), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), and many more!\r\n\r\n\r\nDMCA and Copyright Information:\r\nWe fully own the songs as they are specifically written, produced and performed for the game.
