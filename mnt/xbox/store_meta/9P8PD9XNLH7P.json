  "description": "Aftercharge is an asymmetrical 3 vs 3 first-person online game that pits invisible robots against invincible security guards in quick-paced skirmishes. The robots must sabotage the generators dispersed all over the map while the guards are tasked to spot them and stop them. \r\n\r\nThe game is asymmetrical in design as the two teams not only have different objectives and\r\ndifferent abilities but also offer wildly different play styles. Playing robots is all about sneaking\r\naround, creating distractions and coordinating attacks. Playing guards require careful positioning, good communication and quick reactions.\r\n\r\nAftercharge borrows elements from other competitive shooters but plays around with rules of the genre like ammo management, health, respawn, etc. to create a competitive experience thatâ€™s fresh, centered on teamplay, and very approachable.",
