  "description": "The Remastered Final Cut version for Xbox Series X|S is finally here! \r\nIn This War Of Mine, you do not play as an elite soldier, rather as a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with a lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. During the day you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive.\r\n\r\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\r\nThis War of Mine: Final Cut main features:\r\n- Inspired by real-life events\r\n- Control your survivors and manage your shelter\r\n- Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves―anything that helps you survive\r\n- Make decisions―an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience\r\n- Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game\r\n- Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\r\n- All updates and free expansions added along the way to create the Final Cut",
