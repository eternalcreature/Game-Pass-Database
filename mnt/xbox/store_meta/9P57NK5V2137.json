An accidental fire at a funeral forces the police to re-investigate a closed case of the massacre. Lin Lixun, rookie police, participates in the re-investigation by chance. As the investigation goes deeper, the past of the victims gradually emerges. However, the case becomes more bewildering. Is it a supernatural phenomenon, or an elaborated murder?",
