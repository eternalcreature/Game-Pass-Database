  "description": "Goat Simulator Remastered is the latest in goat simulation technology. Your favorite chaotic sandbox is back and more beautiful than ever, with updated graphics, every DLC, and more bugs that you can shake a goat at. WASD to rewrite history.\n\nYour goal? Chaos! Your muse? Pilgor the goat! If you’ve had your horns in the sand for the last 10 years, Goat Simulator is a game about causing as much destruction as you possibly can, as a goat. Headbutt, backflip and ragdoll your way around each level to earn points, and come up with creative ways to ruin an NPC's day.\n\nGoat Simulator Remastered is the remaster no one asked for. It comes with everything you loved about the original game and more, with new and improved visuals, updated textures, shiny new lighting, and some brand-new foliage showing off the finest in advanced goat simulation technology. We've also completely reworked Mutators, allowing you to pick and choose whichever \"\"goat\"\" you desire from a handy in-game menu. You just have to catch them all first!\n\nThe remaster also includes every DLC from the PC version, and one of our favorites from the mobile version, including:\n- Goat City Bay\n- Goat MMO\n- Goat Z\n- PAYDAY\n- Waste Of Space\n- (Mobile) Buck to School\n\nThere are also less exciting new things, like general optimization and bug fixing - but we promise we mainly fixed the boring ones. \n\nKey Features:\nYou can be a goat… again\nNo really, that’s still the main selling point\nA brand spanking new mutator menu that lets you mix and match goats to your heart's content - if your contentment means abominations\nAs buggy as you remember -  just because it's a remaster doesn’t mean we haven’t left in an unhealthy dose of physics-based bugs because why not?\nAll DLCs included - we could have sold them separately to you again, but if we’re honest this is already a cash-grab\nNew and improved graphics, lighting, VFX and animations - as well as revamped foliage for the prettiest leaves you’ll see in a Goat Sim game excluding Goat Simulator 3\n\nDisclaimer:\nGoat Simulator Remastered is a completely stupid game and has been a completely stupid game since we first invented goat simulation over 10 years ago. We’ve said it before, but you should absolutely be spending your money on something else, like a neat hat, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.",
