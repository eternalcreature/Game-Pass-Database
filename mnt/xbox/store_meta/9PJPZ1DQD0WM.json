  "description": "You are a Runner named Faith – an agile courier who transports sensitive data, using the rooftops to avoid prying eyes. Now your sister has been framed for murder and you’re running for your life.\r\n\r\nThis action-adventure classic delivers you straight into the shoes of a unique heroine as she traverses a vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain: this city will teach you to run.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nMove yourself. String together an acrobatic combination of wall-runs, leaps, vaults and more that uses every level of the urban environment to your advantage.\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself. Through a first-person point of view, every breath, collision and impact is acutely felt. Heights create real vertigo, movements flow naturally and bullet impacts create genuine fear and push you to act.\r\n\r\nChallenge yourself. Your speed and agility allow you not only to evade capture and perform daring escapes, but also to disable and disarm unwary opponents in a mix of chase, strategy and intense combat.\r\n\r\nFree yourself. “Runner vision” allows you to see the flow of the city as Runners do. Rooftops become pathways and conduits, opportunities and escape routes. The flow is what keeps you running – what keeps you alive.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE www.ea.com/legal FOR DETAILS.\r\n",
