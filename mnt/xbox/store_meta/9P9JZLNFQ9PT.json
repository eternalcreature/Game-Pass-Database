  "description": "This game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game. \r\n\r\nA NEW BREED OF BIG MAP MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER\r\nThe goal is simple: Reclaim earth.\r\nIn Second Extinction you take on hordes of mutated dinosaurs with up to two friends. Solo players beware: Second Extinction is designed with squads in mind. Only the strong will survive.\r\n\r\nGAME PREVIEW IS JUST THE BEGINNING\r\nThe goal of Game Preview is also simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible.\r\nWe want to hear your feedback loud and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process.\r\nEven so, there’s plenty to get your teeth (and claws) into from day one: 4 heroes,\r\n10 weapons (with 5 upgrade tiers each) and 6 missions - plus some special side quests - across multiple regions of our big map.\r\n\r\nJOIN THE WAR EFFORT, SHAPE THE FUTURE\r\nOur mantra is that players win battles, communities win wars. Nowhere is this more true than our War Effort feature.\r\nEach region of our big map has a unique threat level. This threat level can be lowered if enough of our players are successful in their missions and activities. But the dinosaurs aren’t resting either, and they’ll focus their efforts where you aren’t.\r\nEach week the community will see the fruits of their labors or feel the consequence of their incompetence. Let the threat level get out of control and you can expect an especially tough Emergence Event to be waiting for you.\r\n\r\nBy playing Second Extinction you’re not just picking up another co-op shooter.\r\nYou’re joining us on a journey as we shape the experience. Every piece of feedback and every mission you play matters. So what are you waiting for? The fight to reclaim earth starts here.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.secondextinctiongame.com/",
