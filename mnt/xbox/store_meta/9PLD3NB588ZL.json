  "description": "“May you find your book in this place.”\r\n\r\nBecome the owner of the Library and receive your guests.\r\n\r\nYour librarians will fight for the Library.\r\nCombat between the guests and the librarians breaks out as if it were on a stage.\r\nDefeated guests turn into books, and the Library grows onward.\r\n\r\nA good book will allow you to invite new guests with greater secrets.\r\nAmass a collection of books and explore the secrets of the City.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, get your hands on…\r\nThe one singular, perfect book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A Library Battle Simulation]\r\n\r\nLibrary of Ruina is a game that uses the concept of a “Library Battle Simulation”.\r\nYou will invite guests to the Library and engage in combat with them to gain 'Books' with their stories.\r\n\r\nBattles are played with the 'Librarians' and the 'Guests' using cards and dice.\r\nYou can plan against the guests’ moves by looking at the cards they will use and select the most optimal card to oppose them.\r\n\r\nWhen combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card fall will determine victory or defeat in the struggle.\r\nHowever, the outcome of the dice is not simply determined by pure luck.\r\nCertain effects and variables will shift the outcome of the dice for and against your favor.\r\n\r\nBe sure to carefully choose which cards you utilize to win the battle with your guests.\r\nBehold the outcome of your choices and how luck unfolds as your librarians and guests skirmish.\r\nYou can go through an exhilarating experience, putting it all on the line with thrills just like betting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Conflicts that Build Emotion]\r\n\r\nConfrontation in the Library is not just about killing your enemies, it is about heightening emotions.\r\nThe emotions of the librarians and guests rise as the battle progresses, and as it grows fiercer and comes to a head, they will surge.\r\n\r\nDepending on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties can occur.\r\nIn addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired.\r\nFurthermore, dialogue can appear depending on the situation of the battle and will make one’s viewing experience of the match unfolding even more enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Books Can Be Anything]\r\n\r\nA guest who dies in the Library will turn into a book.\r\nThese books can be a librarian's body, materials to grow the Library, or new cards for battle.\r\nYou can also use books as the parts of an invitation to bring forth another guest.\r\n\r\nInvite different guests to acquire various books, then utilize them accordingly.\r\nHow you make use of your collection to grow the Library is up to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Story of the City and the Library]\r\n\r\nIn Library of Ruina, you will be witness to the stories of Angela, the Sephirot, and Roland following the ending of Lobotomy Corporation.\r\nYou will also watch various events occurring around the huge city in which the Library is located.\r\n\r\nAccumulate books to grow your Library and librarians, and invite more powerful guests to gain better books.\r\nFrom lowly canards to urban legends and beyond...\r\nThroughout the game, you will gradually become familiar with the story of the City.\r\n\r\nMay you find your book in this place…",
