A mad king, his missing son, and a mysterious archbishop are all pieces of the puzzle you need to hack through. You have journeyed to the source of this evil. A cathedral stands in Tristram, built over the ruins of an ancient monastery. Eerie lights and ungodly sounds echo through its abandoned halls. Tread softly, adventurer; for you tread on nightmares.\n\nLocalization for this game isn't available. You can purchase the game and play it in English only.",
