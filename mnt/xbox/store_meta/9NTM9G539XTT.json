  "description": "This game is still under development, and its content and features are subject to change in the development processes until the final release. Please acknowledge that it is not yet a finished product at the moment before proceeding to purchase it.\r\n\r\nCraftopia is the brand new multiplayer open-world survival action game.\r\n\r\nWe have imagined what would happen when we combine our favorite video games altogether.\r\nChop trees and mine stones as in Sandbox,\r\nExplore the world as in Open-world,\r\nFight the hunger as in Survival,\r\nCultivate and harvest as in Farming,\r\nCollect loots in dungeons as in Hack-and-slash,\r\nAutomate activities as in Factory management,\r\nHunt monsters and creatures as in Hunting action,\r\nCast magical spells as in Fantasy RPG.\r\n\r\nNow we have a utopia for all of us. That is Craftopia.\r\n\r\nFarming\r\n20+ crops are available for you to grow. Of course, you can grow crops one by one, but there are more you can do. With the power of agricultural machines, you can have large scale fields.\r\nWhile enjoying your self-sufficient life, why not make your colorful orchards?\r\nIndustrialization and Automation\r\nYou can automate every single item gathering. When you get tired of cutting woods and mining stones? Let's automate!\r\n...Tired of automation of simple activities? Then let's start using belt-conveyers to build huge factories.\r\n\r\nBreeding\r\nBy throwing Monster Prism at creatures, you can catch them as a pet. Not only animals like cows and deer, but most of the monsters are also tamable. Monsters, Gotta Catch 'Em All!\r\n\r\nExploring Dungeons\r\nWhen the detector starts beeping, it's the sign that you're getting close to a dangerous dungeon. Back to the town to equip yourself, then enter the dungeon in the hope of finding treasures. It changes its shape every time you enter. At the end of the dungeon, you will encounter bosses to fight.\r\nYou will gain new abilities when you unleash the power of the world.\r\n\r\nFishing\r\nIn Craftopia, you can enjoy fishing too. Taste some fresh fish, and craft a shield from turtle shells! Once you get used to fishing on the coastline, it's time to build a ship to sail! Let's catch a whale!\r\n\r\nVehicles\r\nHoverboards, motorbikes, helicopters, automobiles, biplanes, tanks, air balloons, and machinery... Gather materials to craft what you want to ride! You can share a ride with your friends to explore the world together!\r\n\r\nSkill Tree\r\n100+ skills to learn in Craftopia. You can create your character by learning various skills. Some are good at crafting; some are skilled at broad swords; some might do better in automation. Your job will vary throughout the adventure, depending on your play styles!\r\n\r\nCharacter Creation\r\nGender/sex, race, hairstyle, eyes, faces, skin tones, facial hairs, face painting, you can customize all of them!\r\n\r\nMultiplayer\r\nMultiplayer is available. You can build factories, explore dungeons, catch fish with your friends. The choice is yours! You can be an assassin if you want to.",
