  "description": "This game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nANVIL is a multiplayer co-op top-down sci-fi roguelike action shooter where you control characters called Vault Breakers to explore various galaxies that are crawling with monsters. Find relics inside Vaults to increase Breaker's ability to survive and fight on this godforsaken galaxy.\r\n\r\n# ANVIL\r\nAncient Vault Investigation Lab\r\nANVIL is an agency that searches for \"Vaults”, the remnants of alien civilizations scattered throughout the universe. Become a \"Breaker\" searching for “Vaults” and explore the unknown galaxy. Each galaxy consists of random planets and unique boss monsters. By defeating monsters and opening the Vaults, you will be able to utilize the stunning powers within.\r\n\r\n# Breakers\r\nThe Breakers are the seekers of Vaults. They have maximized their combat capabilities to survive various threats that they may encounter on different planets. Breakers with unique abilities and skills are waiting to be selected.\r\n\r\n# Artifacts and Vault Weapons\r\nOver 100 randomly generated artifacts and dozens of weapons will make every session unique and different from previous sessions. You will be able to explore a combination of different playstyles by testing synergy between various artifacts and obtain powerful weapons to get the “ultimate” Breaker!\r\n\r\n# Death and Rebirth\r\nThe Breakers enter combat with their mechanical body. They are rebuilt in ANVIL if they are destroyed during an exploration. Your Breakers will gain EXP during battle that will enhance their strength and give them new powers. The Breakers are not afraid of death because death only makes them stronger when they are rebuilt.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at www.anvil.world.",
