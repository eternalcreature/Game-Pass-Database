  "description": "Welcome to Gamearth, a once peaceful planet now threatened by the warmongering Space Grunts of Nexgen. In the aftermath of their devastating first strike a child named Rise is forced to take on the sacred gun Shine - and with it the fate of his world. Rise & Shine is a true \"think and gun\" that combines elements of arcade shooters, bullet hells, and puzzle platformers to create a new blend of strategy and viscera. Switch between Shine's add-ons to solve puzzles that redefine what bullets can do. Guide projectiles through intricate mazes, electrify damaged equipment to discover new pathways, and juggle 8-bit fruit because why not? It's going to take all you've got to stay alive in the face of lethal robot armadas, enormous bosses, giant death wheels, and (of course) brainthirsty zombies. Oh, and did we mention the graphics? Each level is composed of hand drawn illustrations with multiple parallax scroll layers so every forward step is new. No tiling or repeated elements; each level is one, continuous work of art.",
