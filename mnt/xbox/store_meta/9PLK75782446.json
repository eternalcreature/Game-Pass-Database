  "description": "That's no bubblegum army, that's an endless horde of menacingly pink aliens taking over our planet! Enough sweet talk, grab your gear, we need you and your squad to defeat the pink pests!\r\n \r\nYOUR MISSION: Liberate Earth from the Alien horde!\r\n\r\nHORDE MODE\r\nWe have an emergency on our hands! Resistance is a high-energy “Horde Mode” where you and your (extremely qualified) team will be deployed into unique locations, completing objectives, while surviving waves of pink life forms that increase in difficulty. It’s down to you to save the world. \r\n \r\nCollect Tokens to unlock weapons, items, and perks to boost your stats and build the ultimate loadout based on your playstyle. Complete formidable missions and extract with your squad to gain well-earned experience to level up your character. Additionally, for those that love to flaunt, you can show off your skill to other players in the session with 26 different ranks to work towards! Get out there and make us proud, recruit! \r\n \r\nSTORY MODE\r\nIt’s time to save the world! Embark on a journey to meet fellow earthlings that require your assistance, you virtuoso. You’ll be completing a wide range of exciting missions, usually, through chaotic combat, and yes, you have full permission to destroy everything in your path. \r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #1: Squad Up!\r\nWhile you can play From Space solo (if you're brave enough) you'd be wise to invite some friends to help you out. With online play you can create a four-person squad. Look, there's a lot of those pink pests out there so the more people, the better. Oh, and with a squad, you'll have some witnessess to tell everyone how awesome you are. It's basically a win-win scenario.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #2: Shoot, Explode & Stab\r\nWith a variety of weapons (Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, Flamethrowers and more!) there’s no excuse not to annihilate those aliens! Build your ideal spec and use tactical items such as grenades and mines, or slow down the hordes with barbed wire and machinegun turrets. Remember to scavenge the world for loot, you'll need it!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP #3: You’re special, so pick your specialist skill!\r\nNo matter what type of player you are, there’s a wide range of characters in From Space's roster, each with their own unique ability and weapons. Find the perfect balance with your friends as you build the ultimate super squad.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #4: Don’t just stand there, Level-up!\r\nAs you level-up, you’ll be able to attach special perks to your character, helping you to master the art of destroying aliens. You'll need to find ways to combat increasingly more powerful aliens, and perks will help you accomplish all of your pink alien squashing dreams. Need to rethink your strategy? No problem! We like innovators! Perks can be swapped around, even between your squad!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP 5#: The apocalypse has never been so much fun... so have fun!\r\nWe’re going to level with you... an alien threat is terrifying, terrifyingly fun! Look, the world is already pretty beat up as it is. Who's going to notice if you cause a little bit more destruction while saving the day? People have insurance it's fine...\r\n",
