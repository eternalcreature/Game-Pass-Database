  "description": "In Monsters are Coming! Rock & Road, gather what resources you can to defend an ever-moving city. Are you ready to take on a never-ending army of darkness in a tower-survivor, action-rogue-lite on wheels?\n\n- Fortify: The city must endure! Choose from a selection of town halls, place towers and create your own builds to maximise destruction. Equip defensive structures to repel monsters from the gates and keep the city moving forward, else the darkness will consume you!\n\n- Forage: Gather wood, stone and gold as a persistent, multi-tasking hero. You must constantly balance risk vs reward while fighting back endless armies of monsters. Stray from the beaten path to find richer rewards or keep heading due south towards the safety of shelter. \n\n- Fight: Beat Bad-Ass bosses, improve your abilities, overcome environmental obstacles and take charge of special weaponry to continually adapt your strategies. Or see your city turned to ash!\n\nYou’re the last hope for humanity, but it’s a long road to the Ark.\n\n\nFORTIFY\n\n- Build your city your way. Reach shelter and buy new districts from the city shop. Then strategically choose where to place them  based on the needs of each run.\n\n- Defend yourself. Choose from a variety of unique Town Halls, then add archery outposts, necromancer towers, and even fire-breathing dragons to protect it from the dangers beyond the walls.\n\n- Unlock new possibilities: Find a build that works for you, keep upgrading and try to stay alive against increasingly powerful monsters the closer you get to the Ark!\n\nFORAGE\n\n-  Keep the city stocked: Gather wood to keep the engines burning and increase tower efficiency, chisel stone to help repair and rebuild, and mine gold to expand your moving fortress of destruction. \n\n-  Never stop moving:  Collect compasses at the end of each run and pay your attempts forward, making it easier for future cities to find their way to the Ark!\n\n-  Explore for bonuses: Look for hidden secrets in shelters and tackle side hordes to find richer, rarer rewards. Just make sure you get back to your city in time!\n\nFIGHT\n\n- Progress to Prevail: Level up, increase your potential through vast player progression, and protect the city at all costs, even at the hero’s expense!\n\n- The City Still Stands: Even if the Hero falls, it’s not game over! A run only ends once the city is destroyed, so quickly jump back into the fight before all hope is lost.\n\n- Bad Ass Bosses: Getting to the Ark won’t be easy and there may be some larger monsters waiting for you at the periphery…",
