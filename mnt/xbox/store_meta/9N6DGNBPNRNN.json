  "description": "Flock is a multiplayer co-op game where players take on the role of flying shepherds, each tending to their own unique herd of adorable flying creatures.\n\nThe game is an ode to the joy of flight and discovery. Starting with a small herd of hover-sheep, you nurture and fly them toward fresh, untouched pastures. Along the way, you will discover the secrets of the beautiful uplands and its wild creatures.\n\nWeird flying creatures. Are they fish? Birds? Snakes? Itâ€™s a real mystery. They are mostly friendly though, and with a bit of skill you can charm them to join your flock.\n\nAs your flock grows and your sheep get woolier, you can use the wool you shear from them for hats, cardigans, even socks!\n\nWill you find all the creatures? Even the super rare and elusive ones? Will you keep them to yourself or share them with your friends? Will you knit the longest scarf ever seen? Will you find all the hidden treasures stolen by the pesky Burgling Bewls?",
