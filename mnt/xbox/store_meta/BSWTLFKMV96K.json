  "description": "On the way to Jericho City, your plane is shot down by a mysterious storm and crash-lands in the outskirts. You wake up weeks later in a derelict detention facility inside the city.

With an expanded arsenal of weapons, armors, abilities, implants, and drones to build your character, and a bigger, more varied and more ambitious world, The Surge 2 challenges you to survive and unravel its hidden secrets.\r\n\r\n- Hardcore, brutal melee combat\r\n- Face deadly foes and colossal bosses\r\n- Cut off parts of the enemy you want to loot\r\n- Rich character progression and customization",
