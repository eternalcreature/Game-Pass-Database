  "description": "The definitive edition of the hilarious first-person adventure game Journey to the Savage Planet! Fully optimized for new hardware, running at a snappy 60 frames per second, includes all patches, all that juicy DLC, and a few new cinematics for your viewing pleasure.\r\n \r\nYou have been sent to a distant alien world by your semi-competent employer, Kindred Aerospace, with the aim of finding a new home for humanity! But the world that awaits you is filled with challenges, humor, and surprise, and sadly, Kindred forgot to equip you with any of the gear you will need, meaning you have to go find it and craft it yourself.\r\n \r\nPlay alone or in two-player co-op as you explore a beautiful and surprising alien world to solve the mystery that lurks at its heart before deciding whether or not to return to Earth! Four unique biomes, each with their own flora and fauna to explore. Dozens of wacky creatures to find, catalog, and photograph. A plethora of tools, weapons, and throwables let you tackle the challenges the way you want! Jet Boots! A Grapple! Acid grenades! And more! You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll uncover secrets, and you can do it all with your best friend!",
