  "description": "Four years into the brutal military occupation, America is on its knees.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPhiladelphia - once  the birthplace of Independence - has become a ghetto, where surveillance drones and armoured patrols keep the population at heel, crushing any dissent with savage force.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHer once-proud citizens live in a police state, forced to collaborate just to survive, their dreams of freedom long since extinguished.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBut in the badlands of the Red Zone, in the bombed out streets and abandoned subways, a Resistance is forming. A guerrilla force, determined to fight for their freedoms despite overwhelming odds and ignite the second American Revolution.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBut Freedom always has a price…\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHomefront®: The Revolution is an open-world first person shooter where you must lead the Resistance movement in guerrilla warfare against a superior military force.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA living, breathing, open world responds to your actions - you and your Resistance Cell can inspire a rebellion on the streets and turn Occupation into Revolution, as oppressed civilians take up the fight.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBut your enemy has the advantage - superior technology, firepower, heavy armour and air support. You must learn the art of guerrilla warfare  – ambush, sabotage, infiltration, deception – and fight a running battle through the war-ravaged suburbs of Philadelphia.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAnd the single player campaign is just the start – in Co-Op you and your friends can form your own Resistance Cell and become renowned as Heroes of the Revolution",
