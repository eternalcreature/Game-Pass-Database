  "description": "Sheltered is a deep and emotional survival & post-apocalyptic disaster management game. \n\nAfter a global apocalypse, a frightened family find their way to a deserted shelter, where they try to survive. You take on the role of protecting four family members. Their wellbeing and survival is your responsibility. One mistake, one bad decision and a loved one is gone, forever. Sheltered is a world where death is permanent.\n\nCombat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you try to turn the cold and cramped Shelter into a home. And as they cling desperately to life, you must send family members from the scant protection of the shelter, outside into the dangerous, desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies. You’ll come across abandoned towns, roaming factions and feral beasts.\n\nHow you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter could be the difference between the family surviving or dying. It seems a waste to bury a body when the rest of the family is so hungry.",
