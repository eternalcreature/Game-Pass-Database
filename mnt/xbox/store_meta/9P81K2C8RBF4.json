  "description": "Relic Hunters Legend is a fast-paced looter-shooter RPG where you collect powerful weapons, upgrade skills, and battle enemies in intense combat. Play solo or team up in a 4-player co-op as you embark on a journey to recover lost memories and take down the tyrant Duke Ducan.\n\n\nA Thrilling Looter-Shooter RPG Adventure\nRelic Hunters Legend is a looter-shooter RPG combining fast-paced gunplay, a vast arsenal of weapons, and deep character customization. Defeat enemies, collect rare loot, and refine your build to become an unstoppable force against the Ducan Empire!\n\n\nCustomize Your Hunter\nChoose from multiple playable characters, each with unique abilities. Each of the playable Hunters has 3 fully-realized Skill Trees that you can mix and match as you please, and combined with Attribute point allocation, several Gear and Weapon slots with a deep affix pool, plus a build-defining Relic that you must discover, craft and level up… there’s a LOT more RPG depth here than at first glance!\n\n\nPlay Your Way\nPlay as an offline single player or team up with up to three friends in an online co-op. You can focus on the 30-hour Story campaign right from the get-go… or ignore it COMPLETELY and just focus on progression and endgame systems!\n\nUnlock Hunters in any order you want, and explore the world and its many rewards and challenges in any way you see fit.\n\nEnhance your experience by joining Relic Hunters Legend Official Discord channel (discorg.gg/relichunters). Be among the first to learn about in-development features and talk directly with the Rogue Snail team—we are ALWAYS listening, and we trust that our community always knows what’s best.\n\n\nFast-Paced Combat, Endless Loot\nAll activities are fully playable solo and scale for up to 4-players, including mini open-world Exploration areas, several fast-paced Missions with 7 different Game Modes (Skirmish, Excavation, Payload, Defense, Distraction, Rift, Assault), time-limited Special Missions with random modifiers, Delve dungeons with several bosses (each with their own unique drop tables), as well as endgame Treasure Maps, Asteroid Dungeon Nemesis, and Challenge Mode systems.\n\nThe rain of loot does not stop there, though: you can also befriend different Factions and complete Reputation Quests from them, as well as access NPCs who can help you craft the perfectly-rolled Gear or Weapon for your build!\nItems are not a shallow “gear score fest”, with many different High-End rarities (Exotic, Augmented, Set, Legendary and Unique) and a deep affix pool that can and will change your playstyle completely!\nJoin the Relic Hunters and prove what you're capable of in this action-packed galactic adventure!\n\n\nThe Story\nThe evil emperor Duke Ducan has somehow stolen the past and tells everyone that he is responsible for everything good that has ever happened – providing legitimacy to his oppressive galactic regime.\nThe Relic Hunters, led by Pinkyy, travel around the Galaxy looking for ancient ruins and Relics of the old civilization, trying to restore the memory of the true Past. In this journey, the crew meets a mysterious ally: Seven, who has no memories and the strange ability to travel back and forth through time.\nWanna know more? Our story is also expanded by the Comics (which tell the events that happened before ‘Legend’) and animated short movies! Check out Episodes 1, 2, and 3 for FREE – links on our Steam Community page!\n\n\nPC OPTIMIZED\nWe’ve fine-tuned Relic Hunters Legend to run as smooth as a well-oiled blaster. Enjoy 4K resolution, unlocked framerates, ultrawide support, and fully customizable controls. Whether you’re aiming for buttery-smooth gameplay or maxing out every graphical setting, we’ve got you covered.\n\n\nAbout the devs\nHey there! We’re Rogue Snail, an independent, fully remote game studio from Brazil. Our mission? To make games with heart. We believe that when a team loves what they’re creating, that love shines through in the final game.\nEvery Relic Hunters game is crafted with fun and community at its core. No exploitative mechanics, no scummy microtransactions, no artificial barriers - just focusing on making the most fun game we can make, and making it alongside our community.",
