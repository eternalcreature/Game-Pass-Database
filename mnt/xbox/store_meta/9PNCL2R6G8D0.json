  "description": "Forced to go rogue. Hunted from within. This is Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6.\n\nDeveloped by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops.\n\nThe Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity.\n\nIn a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, players will test their skills across 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.\n\nBlack Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps. With additional content still to come, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.\n\n\nA mobile phone number may be required to be linked to your Activision account to play Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6.\n\nActivision may modify or discontinue online service in the future, which may impact the continued availability of online gameplay. Online services may be discontinued due to factors including number of players.\n\nAdditional storage space may be required for mandatory game updates.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.callofduty.com.\n\n© 2024 Activision Publishing, Inc.
