  "description": "Online multiplayer functionality will be available post-launch on or by July 8, 2022.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sets on the last day of summer camp, the teenage counselors of Hackett’s Quarry throw a party to celebrate. No kids. No adults. No rules. \r\n\r\nThings quickly take a turn for the worse. \r\n\r\nHunted by blood-drenched locals and something far more sinister, the teens' party plans unravel into an unpredictable night of horror. Friendly banter and flirtations give way to life-or-death decisions, as relationships build or break under the strain of unimaginable choices. \r\n\r\nPlay as each of the nine camp counselors in a thrilling cinematic tale, where every decision shapes your unique story from a tangled web of possibilities. Any character can be the star of the show—or die before daylight comes. \r\n\r\nHow will your story unfold? \r\n\r\nYOUR STORY, THEIR FATE\r\nWill you dare to check what's behind that trap door? Will you investigate the screams echoing from within the forest? Will you save your friends or desperately run for your life? Every choice, big or small, shapes your story and determines who lives to tell the tale. \r\n\r\nA STUNNING CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE\r\nCutting edge facial capture and filmic lighting techniques, combined with incredible performances from an iconic ensemble cast of Hollywood talent, bring the horrors of Hackett’s Quarry to life in a pulse-pounding, cinematic thrill ride.\r\n\r\nENJOY THE FRIGHT WITH FRIENDS\r\nPlace your faith in up to 7 friends in online play*, where invited players watch along and vote on key decisions, creating a story shaped by the whole group! Or, play together in a party horror couch co-op experience where each player picks a counselor and controls their actions. \r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE\r\nAdjustable difficulty for all gameplay elements let players of any skill level enjoy the horror. And if you prefer to watch rather than play, Movie Mode lets you enjoy The Quarry as a binge-worthy cinematic thriller. Select how you want the story to unfold, kick back, and munch on some popcorn in between all the screams!\r\n\r\nSTARRING:\r\nDavid Arquette as Chris \r\nAriel Winter as Abigail \r\nBrenda Song as Kaitlyn \r\nEvan Evagora as Nick \r\nHalston Sage as Emma \r\nJustice Smith as Ryan \r\nMiles Robbins as Dylan \r\nSiobhan Williams as Laura        \r\nSkyler Gisondo as Max \r\nZach Tinker as Jacob \r\nEthan Suplee as Bobby\r\nGrace Zabriskie as Eliza\r\nLance Henriksen as Jedediah\r\nLin Shaye as Constance\r\nTed Raimi as Travis\r\n\r\n*Multiplayer functionality across same generation only.",
