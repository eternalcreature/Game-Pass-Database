  "description": "Defeat the most powerful deities in the Greek pantheon, child of Zeus, and take your rightful place on Mt Olympus! Learn to shatter the sky with lightning and shower the earth with fire. Summon heroes to aid your people and plagues to destroy the enemy. Play the second great “god game” from the minds behind Black & White and prove you have what it takes to stand among the divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse dozens of godly powers. Populous 2 bestows even more amazing powers upon you, giving you control of earth, wind, water, wind, flora and – most importantly – people. Protect your crucial settlements with ghastly swamps, create deadly whirlwinds or grow a beautiful forest around the enemy base… before setting it on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummon the heroes of old. Odysseus, Herakles, Perseus and more are yours to command, each with their own special ability. Bless them with your favor and use their strengths well to win the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConquer a massive world. With 1000 maps to conquer, you’re going to have every opportunity to put your skills to the test. Best your enemy on every map (or skip a few when you secure a decisive victory) with the promise of true godhood waiting at the end.",
