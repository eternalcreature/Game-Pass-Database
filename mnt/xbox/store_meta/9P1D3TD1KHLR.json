  "description": "Aliens are decimating New York City and only you have the technology to survive. Adapt in real time using the unique Nanosuit 2 Stealth, Armor and Power abilities, then tackle the alien menace in ways a regular soldier could only dream of.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\nIncludes 4 Limited Edition unlocks. Get bonus XP, a digital camouflage skin and a hologram decoy attachment for the Scar assault rifle, unique platinum dog tags to display your multiplayer rank and status and more.\r\n\r\nIncludes the Retaliation and Decimation packs. Get 9 additional multiplayer maps, supporting all game modes. Plus two new weapons - the FY71 assault rifle and M18 smoke grenade.\r\n\r\nAs of June 2014, our friends at GameSpy have ended all hosted game services, which will affect the online multiplayer aspect of this game. Because of technical challenges and concerns, we do not have a solution to keep these services up and running at this time, and online services for this game and other EA games on the GameSpy platform have ended. We are still investigating a range of options to restore official online functionality and multiplayer gameplay for these titles. You can find more information on this change at ea.com, and find the full list of impacted games on our Online Service Updates page.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE EA.COM/LEGAL FOR DETAILS.\r\n\r\n",
