  "description": "This is ‘Cities: Skylines - Remastered’ for Xbox Series X|S. Purchase of this product also gives you access to ‘Cities: Skylines - Xbox One Edition’. \n\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now remastered for Xbox Series X|S with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. \n\nCities: Skylines - Remastered puts you in charge of a growing city, from the ground-breaking of its first streets to the ever-changing needs of thousands of citizens. Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\n\n\nIntroducing an enhanced player experience for Xbox Series X|S players, including:\n\n• 25 buildable tiles!\n• Quick selection tool\n• UX Improvements (such as precision placements, distance indicator and updated snapping options)\n• New environmental controls panel (adjust things like time of day, rain, fog, and environment colouring)\n• Map editor \n• And an overall graphic performance increase for the bigger city builders! \n\nCities: Skylines Main Features\nBuild the city of your dreams: plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\n\n• Multi-tiered and challenging simulation\nPlaying as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\n\n• Extensive local traffic simulation \nManaging traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\n\n• Districts and policies\nBe more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\n\n• After Dark expansion included \nWatch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\n\nParadox Account required for certain features of the game. You have to be 16 years or older to create a Paradox Account. See https://legal.paradoxplaza.com/eula for details.",
