She exchanges her busy career at a software company to fill in for her dad, the local mail carrier.\r\n\r\nDuring her two-week stay in beautiful Providence Oaks, Oregon, she runs into a few familiar faces as well as plenty of new folk. As Meredith, you get to decide who to talk to, who to befriend and perhaps even start a romantic relationship with.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens, at the end of her stint she'll have to make up her mind: return to her demanding job in the big city, or stay in the town she grew up in?\r\n",
