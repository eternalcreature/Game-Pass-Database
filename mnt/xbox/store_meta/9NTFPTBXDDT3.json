  "description": "WILD HEARTS™ is a unique twist on the hunting genre where technology gives you a fighting chance against fearsome beasts infused with the ferocious power of nature itself. Take on these creatures alone or hunt with friends in seamless co-op.\r\nNo one remembers why the Kemono began their rampage through a once prosperous Azuma. Fueled by desperation, they wield the power of primal nature at its most destructive. For a while, it seemed that none could stand against their overwhelming might. But hope arrives in the form of a formidable hunter, armed with deadly weapons and ancient technology called Karakuri that could turn the tide of battle.\r\n\r\nHUNT GIANT NATURE-INFUSED BEASTS\r\nSurvive their attacks, learn from their behaviors, and use your Karakuri and your weapons in combination to cut these creatures down to size.\r\n\r\nCRAFT YOUR HUNTING GROUNDS\r\nYou are the only one in Azuma able to wield the Karakuri technology. This ancient tech enables you to adapt your environment into creative hunting grounds ideal for taking down the giant Kemono.\r\n\r\nHUNT IN A PACK, OR BE A LONE WOLF\r\nIn WILD HEARTS™ you can face the Kemono alone or unite with up to two friends (or fellow players) to stalk and hunt your prey.\r\n\r\nGEAR UP TO HUNT, HUNT TO GEAR UP\r\nThe more you hunt, the more you progress. Create your character, then gather materials from each hunt and build an array of armor and weapons to bring down even bigger beasts.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE A FANTASY FEUDAL JAPAN\r\nExperience four season-based hunting grounds – each region with its own beautiful landscapes and dangers.\r\n\r\nDeveloped for this generation of platforms by Omega Force, the Japanese studio behind the DYNASTY WARRIORS franchise, WILD HEARTS™ takes you on an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan.\r\n\r\nConditions & restrictions apply.
