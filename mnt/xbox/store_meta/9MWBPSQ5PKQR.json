  "description": "Welcome to the chaotic world\r\nPlebby Quest: The Crusades is a turn-based strategy game set during the crusades of Europe and the Middle East. You must survive between ambitious rulers dreaming of building an empire, treacherous neighbours that long to burn your kingdom, and the religion which always makes unreasonable demands. Survive and build your kingdom’s legacy to last centuries.\r\n\r\nHard, Yet Tender\r\nAfter drawing hard and straight outlines, we drew unique faces for our characters. Then we had them stand in front of solid color tone backgrounds and brought them to life with our in-house software. Behold! They laugh, rage, and tells us their stories with their chewy and tender movements.\r\n\r\nTwo Game Modes\r\nIn Scenario mode you will follow a character’s story, while in Sandbox mode you can conquer the world without any restriction. Each mode is connected and will affect the other. Good choices and decisions from past games will lead your future plays to success.\r\n\r\nFriend or Enemy?\r\nNeighbouring kingdoms remembers your behaviour and will react to it. Critical mistakes bring dissent and lead to war. If you react according to a character’s personality, they will open their mind.\r\n\r\nAccusation\r\nIn the 11th century, persons without faith were either barbarians beyond the borders, or heretics that were burned at stake. Every kingdom is under the influence of a religion, and will demand your kingdom prove their faith.\r\n\r\nConspiracy & Backroom Deals\r\nEvery June, a meeting is held during which believers of each faith gather to condemn and denounce the others. Kingdoms will condemn one another, while religious leaders will stop a war or demand a crusade. You must do anything possible to turn the participants’ opinion to your liking, including bribes, threats, and all kinds of dirty tricks.\r\nAll will be forgiven in the name of God.\r\n\r\nEasy Choices and Terrible Costs\r\nThere are many choices before you start a war. However, once a war begins, everything will come down to either one of two choices: Will you burn them? Or will you be burnt?",
