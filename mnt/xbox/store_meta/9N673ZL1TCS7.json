  "description": "An island outside of reality. A rogue human civilization hoping to resurrect dead alien gods. A murder behind locked doors.\r\n\r\nParadise is an island that regenerates every few millennia. The psychic power that the alien worshipers within release into the universe is meant to feed and eventually resurrect their fallen deities. But this force also attracts undesired interest from demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council.\r\n\r\nThe system isn’t perfect, but it will be one day — on Perfect 25, the next island-to-be. But on the eve of rebirth, the Council is murdered and Paradise is killed.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath, the “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies is summoned from exile to find the culprit. This is the crime to end all crimes.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? What are the truths? Are they the same?\r\n\r\nPARADISE ENHANCED FOR SERIES X/S\r\nParadise Killer arrives ready for next-gen with a full complement of features and enhancements, including 4K60 with ray tracing (Series X) and 4K60 (Series S, Xbox One), Xbox Smart Delivery, super fast loading and more.\r\n\r\nParadise Killer also offers a suite of accessibility options that allow you to tailor the game to suit your needs.",
