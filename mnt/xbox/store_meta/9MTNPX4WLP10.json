  "description": "What do you do when there's a zombie on your lawn? If you answered \"\"start planting flowers to defeat it,\"\" then you've likely heard of Plants vs. Zombies. Armed with dozens of zombie-zapping plants, from the classic peashooter to the devious cherry bomb, you’ll need to think fast and plant faster to stop all types of zombies dead in their tracks. And just when you think you've got a handle on things, obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog, and a swimming pool add to the challenge. With five game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive great modes. Take on a series of 50 challenging tower defense levels in Adventure Mode, then try your hand at fun Mini-Games and other challenges: Test your brain in Puzzle Mode (just be sure to protect it from the zombies!), stay alive as long as you can in Survival Mode, and nurture your plants in the stress-free Zen Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUtter hilarity. Each of the 26 types of zombies and 49 powerful perennials have their own entry in the Suburban Almanac, giving you hilarious descriptions to read through. Want to find out what makes the Disco Zombie special? The answer is just a few pages away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTons of bonus content. The Game of the Year edition of Plants vs. Zombies adds even more fun to the package. You can make your own zombie with the Zombatar, and earn 20 achievements like Home Lawn Security and SPUDOW!\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE EA.COM/LEGAL FOR DETAILS.",
