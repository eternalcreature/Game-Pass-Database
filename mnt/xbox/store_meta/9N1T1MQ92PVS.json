  "description": "It’s time to leave big-city life in Pokyo behind and start a new chapter of your life on Coral Island! \n\n\nBe who you want and create the idyllic farm of your dreams, where you’ll tend crops, nurture animals, and build a bond with the natural world around you. Help revitalize the nearby town and its surrounding coral reefs, and forge relationships with a vibrant community of more than 70 fellow people who call Coral Island home. \n\n\nFarm. Decorate. Craft. Explore. Relax. Your future—and the future of Coral Island—is what you make of it.\n\n\nBuild Your Dream Farm\nTransform your overrun land on Coral Island into a lush and lively dreamscape—you decide what to build, what crops to grow, and which animals you’d like to tend. \n\n\nWrite your own story:  \nThe story changes with each season, but life goes with the flow. Spend your days exploring, or build a life with someone special. Save the seas, brave the caves, or focus on your farm. It’s up to you!\n\n\nMultiplayer Farming:\nTeam up with up to 3 friends (4 farmers total) to build the farm of your dreams! Grow crops, share resources, and uncover local mysteries together. Whether you're farming, fishing, or exploring—life’s better with friends!\n\n\nBe yourself: \nChoose from a wide variety of outfits, accessories, and physiques—you’ll find plenty of options to express yourself, find your style, and be whoever you want to be. \n\n\nBefriend a diverse cast of islanders: \nGet to know the 70+ characters from all walks of life who live on Coral Island. Converse with them, find out more about their interests, and try to impress them with just the right gift.\n\n\nFind that special someone: \nMeet 25 singles who are ready to mingle! Build relationships, sweep them off their feet, and find the one—and when you’re ready, embark on a new chapter of your story together at the farm.\n\n\nRestore an island once paradise: \nMake Coral Island a better place for everyone! Take part in community projects to liven up the town, expand the local museum, and discover how to restore heritage sites. Increase the town's rank and  your community will thrive!\n\n\nCatch of the day: \nIsland living has a lot of perks, including being just a stone's throw away from fun activities like hunting for insects and catching fish.\n\n\nDive the ocean & mine the caverns: \nGo diving to restore the coral reef, or mine precious gemstones in the cavern. Whatever you decide to do, you’ll find loot to hone your tools and upgrade the quality of your livestock and crops.",
