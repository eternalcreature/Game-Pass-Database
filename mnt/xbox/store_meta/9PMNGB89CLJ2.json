Paired with new lightning-fast animations and a substantially upgraded AI, topped by terrifying secrets and new stories to discover filled with brand-new puzzles, brace yourself for a thrill that will send shivers down your spine!\r\n\r\nDescend into a limbo of decaying memories as Benedict Fox, a self-proclaimed detective bound to his demon companion. Use that unholy bond to explore the minds of the recently deceased in search of clues as you uncover the mysteries of a massive, decrepit mansion — the site to a young couple's grisly murder, and the disappearance of their child. Immerse yourself in a dark, intriguing world full of secret organizations, forbidden rituals, and cold-blooded crimes in an arcane adventure brought to life through a fascinating Burton-esque art style.\r\n\r\nEvocatively-crafted Metroidvania\r\nFight demons, explore the subconscious, and solve elaborate puzzles in a labyrinthian adventure inspired by Lovecraft's nightmares, noir pulp fiction, and early 20th-century jazz music.\r\n\r\nDescend into Limbo\r\nUse your bond with the demon to explore the minds of the recently deceased in your last chance to get a “testimony”. Jump into surreal worlds where memories, emotions, and traumas take on a physical form.\r\n\r\nA Grim Mystery \r\nUncover the secrets of an old mansion where a couple has been found slain, and their child has gone missing. Get drawn into a dark, yet intimate intrigue that will have you face the family’s demons - both figuratively and literally!\r\n\r\nDemon-Enhanced Combat\r\nUse your weapons, demon powers, and surroundings in creative combinations to overcome demons, monsters, and cultists - but remember that concentration and a tactical approach are your greatest assets.\"\r\n",
