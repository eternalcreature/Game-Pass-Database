  "description": "The Talos Principle is a philosophical first-person puzzle game from Croteam, the creators of the Serious Sam series, and written by Tom Jubert (FTL, The Swapper) and Jonas Kyratzes (Infinite Ocean).\r\n\r\nAssume the role of a sentient artificial intelligence placed within a simulation of humanityâ€™s greatest ruins and linked together through an arcane cathedral. Players are tasked with solving a series of increasingly complex puzzles woven into a metaphysical parable about intelligence and meaning in an inevitably doomed world.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the package is The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna - a substantial expansion consisting of four episodes that take experienced players through some of the most advanced and challenging puzzles in the game, with a new story, new characters and a new society with its own history and philosophy.",
