  "description": "Bard's Gold is a challenging platformer that let's you explore eerie worlds in a quest for a Goblin that stole your gold. Help the Bard to overcome the dungeon’s many dangerous perils and use your new-found treasures to improve your character and to buy new weapons and gear! \n\nThis game takes inspiration from early 90's platforming classics such as Rainbow Island, Rick Dangerous and Alex Kidd, which at the time were popular on the Amiga and consoles. Bard's Gold is slower paced than most current day platformers, but is extemely challenging. Players need to avoid enemies, traps and projectiles in order to progress. Being hit by any of them means instant death. Difficult puzzles and towering bosses will have to be overcome to reach the filthy goblin that stole the family treasure.\n\nKey Features:\n\nOld school platforming experience - No tutorials or explanations how things should be done. Everything including the basic game mechanics must be figured out by yourself as you go. \n\nRogue-lite - Different layouts for each level is randomly chosen every playthrough. While getting the chance to memorize levels and get better at them, the \"random level\" system will keep your interest. With the gems you collect you will be able to upgrade your character on the Game Over screen. These upgrades are permanent and will help you on future playthroughs. \n\n100+ Randomly picked levels to play\n\nExtremely challenging, yet rewarding gameplay \n\nBeautifully designed retro-inspired graphics \n\nGain powerful new abilities by finding skill books \n\nDeath will make you stronger \n\nSolve intricate puzzles and defeat towering bosses",
