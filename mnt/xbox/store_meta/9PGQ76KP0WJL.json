  "description": "When humans get too lonely, they turn into monsters…  \r\n\r\nSea of Solitude takes you on a personal journey of a young woman’s loneliness.  Set sail across a beautiful and evolving world, where nothing is quite what it seems.  Meet fantastical creatures and monsters, learn their stories, and solve challenges.  Explore a flooded city, either by boat, on foot, or by swimming through the water itself.  Dare to look what lies beneath the surface, in a haunting struggle of darkness and light, and discover what it truly means to be human.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n- AN EMOTIONAL JOURNEY\r\nSea of Solitude embarks players on a nuanced and intimate action-adventure, experienced through the mind of Kay, as she struggles to overcome her inner loneliness.  Players must help Kay see below the surface and beyond, guiding her through her Sea of Solitude, in this deeply touching tale of darkness and light.   \r\n\r\n- A METAPHORICAL WORLD\r\nAs her journey evolves, Kay’s dark and stormy environment begins to transform, with light and color shining into the world.  Water levels rise and fall to reflect her own state of mind, transforming the flooded city landscape into new areas for the player to explore, with new challenges to face.  \r\n\r\n- FACE THE MONSTERS WITHIN\r\nEncounter fantastical creatures, solve puzzles, and rid the world of tainted memories.
