With intuitive controls and three difficulty settings, the size of the challenge ahead is up to you.\r\n\r\nThen team up together in local multiplayer and put your strategic skills to the test in games like Capture the Flag, Horde, Last Stand and more. It’s the strategy action game TRANSFORMERS fans have waited an eternity for!\r\n",
