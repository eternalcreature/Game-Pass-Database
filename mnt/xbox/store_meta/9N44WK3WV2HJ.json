  "description": "Join the chaos of war and be a part of the most iconic battles of the Eastern and Western Fronts, including Carentan, Omaha Beach, Stalingrad, Kursk and more. Hell Let Loose drops you into the action, where you will have to fight across fields, bridges, forests, towns and more war-torn environments! Lumbering tanks will be dominating the battlefield and crucial supply chains fuelling the frontlines, you are essential to the colossal, combined arms warfare. \r\n\r\nTake to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle. \r\n\r\nThe combat takes place across huge, to-scale maps, recreated by utilising aerial and satellite imagery of real battle locations  in stunning detail using Unreal Engine 4. These realistic battlefields are divided up into large capture sectors allowing emergent and constantly unique gameplay to evolve between the two forces of fifty players. Work as a team and make continual large scale, tactical decisions as to where to attack or defend.\r\n\r\nManage resources and supplies to call in support, bombing runs, new vehicles, strafing runs and to reinforce strong-points or flank enemies. When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\r\n\r\nHell Let Loose is not about kill to death ratios – teamwork is central to gameplay. Communication is essential. Players work together beneath the leadership of Officers and their Commander to take strategic targets on the battlefield and dominate the opposition. In Hell let loose, it’s always better to tackle things as a team. If you think you can handle the chaos of war, we’ll see you on the frontlines!",
