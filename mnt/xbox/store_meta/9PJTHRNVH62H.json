  "description": "The world is a vast, beautiful, and dangerous place – especially when you have been shrunken to the size of an ant. Explore, build, and survive together in this cooperative survival-adventure. Can you thrive alongside the hordes of giant insects, fighting to survive the perils of the backyard? \r\n\r\nUncover the mysteries while playing through the story!\r\nHow did you wind up so small? Who did this to you? How do you go home? These are all answers you will uncover as you play through the story.\r\n\r\nSolo or with friends – anytime!\r\nYou can face the backyard alone or together, online, with up to three friends. Not only that, but with the Shared Worlds feature, you can continue to play in your shared world even if the original host is not on, with all your progression saving!\r\n\r\n(Online console multiplayer requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass Core, sold separately.)\r\n\r\nNowhere is safe – not even your base.\r\nCreatures can be found roaming the yard in a multitude of environments, such as the depths of the pond, the caverns of the termite den, and even the sweltering heat found in the sandbox. You can even attract them to different places in the yard by activating the MIX.R devices. However, the more you interfere with the creatures in the yard, the higher the chance that they come knocking at your own door, so you better prepare.\r\n\r\nPlay true to your playstyle!\r\nUse the in-game customization systems such as Mutations and Milk Molars to activate the bonuses and perks you want for your character. Not only that, but craft and upgrade your armor and weapons to give your character the stats and advantages you need in order to take on the perils of the backyard.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to go big, or never go home!",
