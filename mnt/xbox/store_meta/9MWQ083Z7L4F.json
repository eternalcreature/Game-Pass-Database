  "description": "When history tells the story of the Fifth Blight, what will be said about the hero who turned the tide against the darkspawn? Determine your legacy and fight for Thedas as a noble dwarf, an elf far from home, a mage apprentice, or a customized hero of your own design. Experience many unique origin stories on your quest to unite the kingdoms and defeat an ancient evil.\r\n\r\nDetermine your origin. Customize your hero's physical appearance and character alignment, but choose wisely. Your race and combat class will define your origin, both within Thedas and beyond. Choices determine where you begin your journey and future interactions.\r\n\r\nBuild loyalty. Recruit over a half-dozen party members, including mages, deadly assassins, a berzerker dwarf, and a warrior from the giant Qunari race. With so many different personalities, you'll have to watch your words to build trust, loyalty, and maybe even romance.\r\n\r\nMake every move count. Combine your own moves with those of your teammates to build a melee attack. Fight in real-time with hard-hitting strikes, or assign individual orders to teammates for a more tactical approach. \r\n\r\nUltimate Edition Includes:\r\n\r\nAwakening Expansion Pack: Become the commander of the Grey Wardens and embark on a new campaign in the world of Amaranthine. You'll fight new enemies, learn new spells, and fend off the advancing Darkspawn forces.\r\n\r\nNine Content Packs to add new quests, spells, abilities, and in-game items to your adventure. (Full List: The Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep, Return to Ostagar, Feastday Gifts, Leliana's Song, The Darkspawn Chronicles, The Golems of Amgarrak, Witch Hunt, and the Blood Dragon Armor for use in Dragon Age: Origins and Mass Effect 2.)\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY.
