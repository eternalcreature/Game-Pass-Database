So, unleash Krypto’s Heat Vision and Arctic Bark powers, or Ace’s Batarangs and Shoulder Charge attacks, to bring the evil LexBots to heel. Rescue animals along the way, before they’re locked up in LexCorp Zoo and prepare for the ultimate battle with Lex and his high-tech War Suit. \r\n\r\nBeing a Super-Pet isn’t all ruff and tumble. Pamper your furry friends at the Adoption Center to help them find forever homes and receive special rewards. And hang out with your pals Chip, Merton, and PB to learn superpower upgrades. It’s a bird… It’s a plane… It’s the DC Super-Pets! ",
