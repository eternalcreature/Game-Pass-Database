Now you must find your way out...or stay trapped forever. \r\n\r\n((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n• Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.\r\n• Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.\r\n• Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality.\r\n• Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.\r\n• Created mostly by one person. \r\n• Become friends with all of the bosses!\r\n• At least 5 dogs.\r\n• You can date a skeleton.\r\n• Hmmm...now there are 6 dogs...?\r\n• Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton.\r\n• I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.\r\n• If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it",
