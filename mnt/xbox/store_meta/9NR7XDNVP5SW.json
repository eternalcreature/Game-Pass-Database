  "description": "As Dusk Falls is an original interactive drama from INTERIOR/NIGHT that explores the entangled lives of two families across thirty years. Starting in 1998 with a robbery-gone-wrong in small town Arizona, the choices you make have a powerful impact on the characters’ lives in this uncompromising story of betrayal, sacrifice and resilience.\r\n\r\nReplay the story again and again to uncover vastly different outcomes for the characters and explore hidden nuances behind every decision. Will your characters survive unscathed? What kind of people will they ultimately become?\r\n\r\nDrive the lives and relationships of multiple characters in a decades-spanning story told across two intense books.\r\n\r\nUncompromising Crime Drama. The cinematic story is brought to life by the performance of actors that are digitally rendered into a beautiful art style, creating a unique experience that plays like a motion graphic novel.\r\n\r\nSacrifice vs Survival. Can you break free from your family’s toxic influence? What will you sacrifice for the ones you love? Can you overcome your past? Your decisions will shape the characters’ fates.\r\n\r\nInterwoven Destinies. Follow two families in their struggle to survive, protect, and endure through challenges rooted in the previous generations’ mistakes.\r\n\r\nExperience Together. Reveal insights about yourself and those you play with as you discover the underlying values of your decisions in cooperative gameplay with up to 8 players at a time, locally or online (or a mix). The As Dusk Falls companion app makes making choices in game easy, just use your phone or tablet to vote with or against your friends. (Online console multiplayer requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass Core, subscriptions sold separately).",
