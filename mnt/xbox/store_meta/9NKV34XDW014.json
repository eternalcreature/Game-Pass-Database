  "description": "This game is still under development. It is subject to change before its release as a finished product. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\n\nQ. What kind of game is this?\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\nYou can even sell them or eat them.\n\n▼Survival\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\n\n▼Mounts & Exploration\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\n\n▼Building Structures\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.\n\n▼Production\nFind a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\n\n▼Farming\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\n\n▼Factories & Automation\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\n\n▼Dungeon Exploration\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\n\n▼Breeding & Genetics\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\n\n▼Poaching & Crime\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\n\n▼Multiplayer\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\nIn online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.\nMeanwhile, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.\n\nCollect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!",
