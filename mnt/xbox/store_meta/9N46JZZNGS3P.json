  "description": "Control the spice, control the universe.\r\n\r\nThis is your desert, your Dune.\r\n\r\nLead your faction and battle for control and dominance over the harsh desert planet of Arrakis. Spice is the most valuable resource in the universe. The spice extends life, expands consciousness, and makes interstellar travel possible. Found only on Arrakis, it is sought by the most influential forces in the Imperium…\r\n\r\nScan the landscape for wormsign or risk losing your troops and spice harvesters to colossal sandworms who will burst through the dunes to devour them whole. Crush your opponents in combat, best them through political intrigue, and undermine them with your network of illusive spies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Herbert's Dune.\r\n\r\nExperience the unique Dune universe, one of the most influential sci-fi settings ever created. Lead your faction to victory with iconic characters, such as Duke Leto Atreides, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Esmar Tuek, and Liet Kynes. Stay alert as opposing factions seek to gain the upper hand and the planet itself threatens with vast deserts, huge storms, and the dreaded sandworms.\r\n\r\n\r\nForge your own path to victory.\r\n\r\n4X in real time.\r\n\r\nBalance open warfare, subterfuge, political influence, and economic supremacy to prevail and gain control over the most important planet in the universe. Use secretive agents to sabotage the plans of your opponents. Vote on political resolutions in the Landsraad to further your strategy. Or dominate your opponents by overwhelming them with an all out assault.\r\n\r\nExplore Arrakis with ornithopters to discover resources, villages, and points of interest. Expand with your troops to take control of regions. Exploit the resources through buildings and spice harvesters to dominate the economy. Deploy your spaceships and aircrafts to exterminate your enemies but beware as outright aggression can have high political repercussions.\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose your faction.\r\n\r\nEmbark on a strategic journey where you can choose the path of honor and politics or embrace violence and deceit. Choose from various factions with unique abilities and playstyles. Each faction can be customized by selecting councilors who enhance their strengths and mitigate weaknesses.\r\n\r\nWhether you choose survival tactics, shady dealings, military might, or dominating the spice trade, there is a faction and councilor combination for every player's preference. Explore the possibilities and shape your own destiny on Arrakis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Arrakis. \r\n\r\nConquest mode.\r\n\r\nTake control of one of the major houses and fight through a number of unique scenarios and situations. Personalize your starting house with a variety of perks and upgrades to tackle the many challenging objectives of the Conquest mode, ensuring you a unique experience every time you play.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to 4-player multiplayer.\r\n\r\nBand together in 2v2 matches or face each other in a free-for-all of up to four players. Tailor the parameters of your multiplayer match to your preferences, including AI difficulty, map size, victory conditions, sandworm aggression, storms, and number of Sietches. Team up and try different faction combinations to identify synergies and dominate Arrakis.\r\n",
