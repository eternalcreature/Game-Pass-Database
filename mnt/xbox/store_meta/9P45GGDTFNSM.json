  "description": "PowerWash Simulator is back, satisfaction is a spray away!\n\nDust off your power washer and relax into pure feel-good fun. Blast away every last speck, smear and splatter of filth to restore Muckingham (and beyond ðŸ‘€) to gleaming glory.\n\nCraving more to Clean?\n\nThe jobs and water keep flowing in PowerWash Simulator 2. Play through a fresh new campaign, uncovering more of Muckinghamâ€™s mysteries. Plus, venture even further out to brand-new grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.\n\nAlongside new locations and jobs, youâ€™ll also find a new job type. Multi-stage jobs will unlock different areas of a job â€“ from vehicle interiors to entirely different rooms, your to-do list keeps growing.\n\nTools of the Trade\n\nReach new heights of power washing professionalism with a range of new tools to help you achieve a spectacular sparkle, high and low. Realise even your loftiest cleaning ambitions with the help of an all-new abseiling rig and cherry picker or stay grounded with a grime busting surface cleaner for large areas.\n\nNo Place like your Home-base\n\nKick back and relax in your home-base after a hard-days-cleaning. Make the place yours by collecting furniture and trinkets to spruce it up along the way, then invite your power wash pals over to check out your pad. \n\nYou didnâ€™t think weâ€™d leave your furry friends in the van, did you? Your pretty kitties are the purr-fect distraction for when youâ€™ve pressed paws on work for the day. \n\nSoap-erior Washing\n\nWatch your worries melt away with each swipe of your power washer. Cleaning feels even better in PowerWash Simulator 2, with enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt. \nClean in Split-screen!\n\nSatisfaction on the double! Share campaign progression online together for the first time. In addition to online play, split-screen co-op has entered the chat. Team up and take on the dirt with twice the wash-power, from the convenience of one screen.",
