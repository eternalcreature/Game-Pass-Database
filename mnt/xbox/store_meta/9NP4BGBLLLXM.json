Each player has the same resources and opponents to create a level playing field. With the clock ticking, it’s a test of who can make the best decisions under pressure. Only a true speed demon can remain undefeated.\r\n\r\nDAILY CHALLENGE\r\nTake on a new challenge every day with a hugely modified run due to gameplay mutators. Compete globally and against friends, and climb the leaderboards with a skill-focused scoring system.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM CHALLENGE\r\nDesign your own unique challenge and share it with friends.
