He can, however, absorb the traits of anything he eats, is virtually indestructible, and can grow to unlimited size.  If he wasn't a danger to all life in the universe, he'd make the perfect pet.  In this action/adventure game, he's the best friend of our hero Frank, and only by working together can Maw eat their way to freedom.",
