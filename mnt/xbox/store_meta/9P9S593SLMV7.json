  "description": "The Anacrusis is a four-player, cooperative first-person shooter set aboard a massive starship stranded at the edge of explored space. Team up with your friends in an infinitely-replayable fight against alien hordes to unlock perks, weapons, and new ways to play that you can share with your team! The Anacrusis is launching in Game Preview in January 2022!\r\n\r\nNever Fight the Same Battle Twice\r\nIn The Anacrusis, the AI Driver controls every aspect of the game. It spawns every enemy, directs each boss, and places every weapon, gadget, and health kit. No matter your skill level, you'll find the perfect level of challenge. More than that, the AI Driver creates the kinds of video game moments that you canâ€™t wait to tell your friends about.\r\n\r\nFight Aliens Using Fantastical Weapons\r\nBattle the alien menace using an astounding arsenal of classic sci-fi weapons. Buy yourself some time with a stasis grenade, toss a shield grenade to provide instant cover while you pop off a heal, and bring your friends back to life using the respawner. Or throw caution to the wind and burn friend and foe alike with the laser rifle.\r\n\r\nEarn New Perks and Change the Way You Play\r\nMatter compilers spread throughout the game give you access to dozens of perks that will change the way you play. Stack all of your upgrades to power up the last-resort pistol or boost your defense by supercharging your shield pulse. Unlock new perks as you play, and share your unlocks with everyone on your team!\r\n\r\nA Fight For Survival Is Just the Beginning\r\nThe first season of The Anacrusis tells the story of four unlikely survivors--Nessa, Guion, Liu, and Lance--who are unwilling combatants in the battle to defend humanity from the alien menace. Play more and unlock more of the unfolding mystery of the alien attack.\r\n\r\nThis game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.",
