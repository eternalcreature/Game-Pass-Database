  "description": "The three time IGF award nominated 1000xRESIST is a thrilling sci-fi adventure. 1000 years in the future, humanity is all but extinguished and a disease spread by an alien occupation keeps the survivors underground. You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything.\nTHE END OF HUMANITY\nIn the near future we learn we are not alone in the universe. A mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants.\nThey are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet.\nThere is one survivor, a teenage girl called Iris. Somehow she is immune.\nSOCIETY IS REBORN IN HER IMAGE\n1000 years later. Iris is not only immune but immortal. She has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones.\nShe calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER.\nUnlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack.\nThe ALLMOTHER lives in her own compound on the front line of the war with the Occupants. All Sisters dream of one day being able to take the train and join her in the fight.\nRELIVE HER MEMORIES\nWithin the Orchard, every sister has an assigned function, while six sisters have special roles to play…\nPrincipal - Head of administration and oversight of the Orchard\nBang Bang Fire - Head of military\nKnower - Head of knowledge preservation\nFixer - Head of engineering\nHealer - Head of medical and cloning\nAnd you - the new Watcher.\nYour role is unique. You have the great privilege of reliving and interpreting the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process known as Communion, made possible by Secretary, your floating AI companion.\nAs the game begins, you are excited to embark on your first Communion.\nRESIST A THOUSAND YEAR OLD LIE\nBut all is not well.\nYour closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be.\nFixer’s claims rock the foundations of your world, throwing everything you know and believe into doubt.\nAfter Fixer is executed for her treason, it falls to you to discover the truth.\nDISCOVER THE TRUTH\nDive into the memories of the ALLMOTHER.\nExplore pivotal moments in her life from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters.\nJump back and forth through moments in time within these memories to solve puzzles and access locked off areas and secrets.\nIn between Communions, explore the Orchard - a large underground hub area which houses you and your sisters, has many characters to speak to, and holds many things to uncover.\nFind the truth and reclaim your legacy.\nA STORY LIKE NO OTHER\nExperience perspective shifts both literal and metaphorical as the game blends between 3rd person adventure, visual novel and first person walking simulator while throwing twists, turns and revelations at you until you question everything you think you know.\nBorn from an eclectic set of inspirations, including the games of Yoko Taro (NieR:Automata), the anime of Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue) and Naoko Yamada (A Silent Voice), and even the theatre of Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach), 1000xRESIST tells a story in ways only a game can while simultaneously bringing fresh ideas to interactive storytelling from theatre, dance, performance art, and cinema.\nFULLY VOICED\nEnjoy more than 10 hours of playtime brought to life with over 15,000 lines of fully voiced dialogue from a brilliant cast of Asian-Canadian actors and an incredible soundtrack from two composers.",
