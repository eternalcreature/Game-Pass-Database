  "description": "Die for Valhalla! is an action RPG where you hack, slash and crush your enemies! Possess and take full control of heroes, monsters and other things to help Vikings save their realm!\r\n\r\nYou are a Valkyrie, from Old Norse valkyrja \"chooser of the slain\". You embark on a quest that will lead you through strange lands where Norse Mythology collides with Lovecraftian mythos. Sounds Weird? Well, because it is!\r\n\r\nYou can play solo or with friends locally (up to 4 players).\r\n\r\nTwo ways to enjoy the story:\r\nThere are two story modes in the game: Beat ‘Em Up and Rogue-lite.\r\n\r\nBeat ‘Em Up mode procedurally generates a larger world to explore with a more relaxed difficulty curve. You can revive your friends and the potions you find have useful or hilarious effects (or both).\r\n\r\nRogue-lite mode generates a smaller world featuring steeper difficulty curve and permadeath. Some of the potions you find have malicious effects and you have to learn which ones to avoid in each run.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- Randomized levels generated from hand-picked modules.\r\n- Action gameplay inspired by classic beat ‘em ups.\r\n- More than 10 Viking Clans to discover and unlock . Each Clan has a special bonus and access to different Viking Classes.\r\n- Each of the 7 Viking Classes comes with unique play styles and combos.\r\n- Over 80 skills to choose from when leveling up your Valkyrie.\r\n- Cute but bloodthirsty creatures will become your companions. Each has a different ability to aid you on your journey.\r\n- Four player local co-op.\r\n- Deathmatch Challenge : Battle other players in a free-for-all battle.\r\n- Survival Challenge: Test your skills and compete with your friends.",
