  "description": "When insurance companies dodge the responsibility, it’s up to you to save your daughter’s life. This will require some dirty work and shady clientele, but you have no other choice, right? When the big boss calls once again, bring a bucket and a mop cause you will really need them. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nYou need nerves of steel to clean crime scenes left behind by major and minor criminals. You may not have money for your daughter’s hospital stays, but what you do have is a very particular set of skills. With the help of an entire arsenal of equipment, you will clean blood, pack up bodies, and remove any odor. All this under the pressure of a ticking clock and police breathing down your neck.\n\nKey Features:\n\nDeep Clean - Grab your trusty mop and sponge. They will be handy for the majority of the missions. When the mess becomes too much, whip out the powerwasher and clean the outside spaces deeply. Or when the smell is a bit too strong, you have more than just an odor eliminator.\n\nArm’s Race - Sometimes, the equipment you have is not enough and needs an extra oomph. If your lamps or flashlights are not strong enough, get new ones! If there is too much blood outside, get a different set of power washer nozzles! So, before every mission, check the perks available and boost your cleaning arsenal. If you can make your job easier... why not take that opportunity?\n\nDeep Pockets - Make money in any way you can! Mobsters are known for being generous, but sometimes that’s not enough. And certain objects may be too tempting. Who is going to miss this expensive watch? The owner’s already dead.\n\nIt’s about Family - With all the gruesome things you will see and do on every job, you must not forget that you are doing this for her. The life of a single father has its challenges, and you need to overcome them all.\n\nSo, are you the bad guy? You’re simply a man with the brains and brawn to take fate into his own hands. You’re the man of the hour, so clean, keep your head down and get that cash.\n",
