  "description": "An unusual error manifests on April 4th, a day that echoes the enigmatic code 404. In a desperate act of innocence, a child relinquishes her name for an invitation to a birthday party, her hope tethered to the faint possibility of finding her brother. \n\nMeanwhile, Alex, a recent college graduate, returns home, only to find his reality unspooling like a threadbare tapestry. Guided by a cat which slips through the very fabric of his mind, Alex descends into the depths of his consciousness where he witnesses the impossible: a woman, locked away in an iron maiden, vanishing into thin air. A vision which ignites an undying obsession and threatens to unravel the boundaries of his world.\n\nPrepare to take into your veins the I.V. patch of YIIK: A Postmodern RPG, the surrealist Japanese-style RPG from Ackk Studios and Ysbryd Games.",
