  "description": "Version 2.0 - Out Now\n\nFollowing over 50 post-launch updates, the definitive Lords of the Fallen Version 2.0 has finally arrived and adds further significant improvements, including: \n\nShared-Progression Crossplay Co-Op\nBuilding on seamless co-op, both players will now save all mainline progress as long as you’re on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough and have killed the same number of main bosses (within one). In all play sessions, both players will retain all loot, 100% vigor, and have the ability to revive each other. \n\nFree Friend’s Pass\nInvite any friend to join your adventure in online co-op even if they don’t own the game. Friends will retain all loot and character progression between online sessions, and have free offline access to the full tutorial and character creator. \n\nRevamped Combat & Movement\nV2.0 introduces enhanced character movement and combat, including more precise attack animations and improved weapon responsiveness, more effective evasions, a refined lock-on system, new grievous strike button prompts, and more. \n\nDedicated Jump Button\nPlayers can now jump at any time with a single button press allowing for much more intuitive platforming. \n\nFull Weapon Audio Overhaul\nEvery weapon now delivers a richer, more impactful soundscape, amplifying every swing, parry, and block for a more immersive and satisfying combat experience.\n\nOverhauled Character Creator\nCraft more realistic and visually striking characters with improved facial detail, body shapes, and overall visual fidelity for both male and female models.\n\nModernized UI & HUD Options\nA new user interface is cleaner and easier to navigate, while you can now also disable the HUD for a more immersive experience or use the dynamic HUD setting, where it fades in and out based on gameplay.\n\nImproved Tutorial Experience\nThe updated tutorial offers clearer, more intuitive instructions. Additionally, a new in-game guidebook means you can reference previous prompts at any time throughout your adventure.\n\nUmbral Lamp Guidance\nYour Umbral lamp now has the ability to highlight the path towards your next vestige point, aiding lost crusaders through the winding passages of Mournstead.\n\nLords of the Fallen introduces an all-new, epic RPG adventure in a vast, interconnected world.\n\nAeons after his defeat by the hands of man, the demon God Adyr’s resurrection draws nigh. As a fabled Dark Crusader, journey through the realms of the living and the dead in this expansive RPG experience to overthrow Adyr once and for all. Featuring colossal boss battles, fast challenging combat, and deep, immersive storytelling.\n\n\nExplore A Vast, Interconnected World\nJourney across two expansive, parallel worlds - the world of the living and the dead - with each harbouring its own pathways, secrets, treasures… and foes. \n\nMaster Fast, Challenging Combat\nChoose from 100s of unique weapons, from heavy-hitting flails to rapid-fire crossbows, or forgo metal for magic with devastating attacks of the arcane.\n\nUnite in Online Multiplayer\nExperience the campaign alone, or unite with other players in full ‘shared progression’ online co-op. Provided you and your companion are on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough and have defeated a similar number of main bosses (within one), both players will save all mainline progress. Or invite any friend who doesn't own the game to adventure by your side using the Free Friend’s Pass. \n\nCustomise your Journey\nWith the Advanced Game Modifier System, fully customise your gaming experience, including enemy density, randomised loot, pre-upgraded weapons, permadeath, and more.\n\nDefine Your Legend\nPersonalise your character’s appearance before selecting one of nine varied character classes. Whichever starting path you take, develop your own playstyle by upgrading stats and weapons.\n\nPost-Launch Updates\nOver 50 post-launch updates have been released, vastly improving the experience with significant performance enhancements, rigorous difficulty balancing in response to player feedback, multiple new questlines, enhanced combat and character movement, and a number of new Quality-of-Life features.",
