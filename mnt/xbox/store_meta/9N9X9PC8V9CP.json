  "description": "From the depths of darkness, a dragon soars. \r\n\r\nA new dark fantasy Three Kingdoms action RPG, presented by Team NINJA.\r\n\r\n184 AD, Later Han Dynasty China. The land is overcome by chaos and destruction. The imperial dynasty that prospered for many years is now about to collapse. \r\n\r\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a dramatic, action-packed story of a nameless militia soldier fighting for survival in a dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty where demons plague the Three Kingdoms.  Players fight off deadly creatures and enemy soldiers using swordplay based on the Chinese martial arts, attempting to overcome the odds by awakening the true power from within. \r\n\r\nWo Long refers to a crouching dragon, and also refers to a hero or person of greatness who is not yet known. This is the story of officers, who will later become heroes, during their ‘unknown’ period, and also the story of a protagonist’s rise from being a ‘nobody’.\r\n \r\nNote: You must have an internet connection in order to use various content.\r\nNote: This is the standard edition of the game. The Complete Edition is also available.",
