  "description": "Sketch Turner is an artist in New York City. One day Sketch is drawing, and a then there is a huge thunderstorm in the city. A bolt of lightning hits Sketch's image, and brings it to life. That image is Mortus, a megalomaniac mutant who wants to become real and to rule the earth. Mortus magically transports Sketch into the pages of his comic book so that he can end his creatorâ€™s life and become real. Inside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero that came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil brought by Mortus' hand. Now that he's a comic book superhero, Sketch can kick some serious butt. Instantly, Sketch can fight like a one-man mercenary platoon! This game requires the Xbox 360 hard drive or the 512MB Memory Unit for storage. There are no refunds for this item. For more information, see www.xbox.com/live/accounts.",
