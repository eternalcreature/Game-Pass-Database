  "description": "Introducing the FieldSENSE™ Gameplay System in Madden NFL 23\r\n\r\nProviding the foundation for consistent, ultra-realistic gameplay, and available on Xbox Series X|S Madden NFL 23’s new FieldSENSE™ Gameplay System equips players with more control at all positions in every mode. FieldSENSE leverages animation branching technology and a suite of new user control mechanics for a seamless gameplay flow with authentic results on every play.\r\n\r\n360° Cuts\r\nWhether you're a running back, wide receiver after the catch, or returning a kick, new 360° Cuts give you the freedom and fluidity as the ball-carrier to hit the gaps you want to hit, plant-and-go, and elude defenders to break more big plays.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Passing\r\nLead your receivers open, drop back-shoulder throws into tight windows, and place every pass where only your receiver can catch it with surgical accuracy thanks to this all-new way to pass. New skill-based passing introduces an accuracy reticle and passing meter.\r\n\r\nHit Everything\r\nRedefining defensive pursuit, new Hit Everything mechanics let you be more disruptive on defense. New animation branching technology in Madden NFL 23 enables next-gen Hit-Stick physics so you can perform mid-air knockouts, hit the pile to assist in tackles already in progress, blow up blocks, and force turnovers with stand up tackles.\r\n\r\nFace of the Franchise: The League\r\nThe League drops you into your fifth NFL season at a skill position of your choice (QB, WR, RB, CB, MLB) and you’re seeking a fresh start with a new team. Negotiate a one-year “prove-it” contract with one of 32 NFL teams and show out with great on-field performance to earn rewards and level up. New position-specific mechanics brought to life by FieldSENSE* and player-focused cameras bring you closer to the action and add to gameplay depth by allowing you to dominate every snap, from anywhere on the field. The addition of New Drive Goals and Drive Summaries allow you to tweak your experience throughout a game and get feedback and rewards based on how well you play. Get performance boosts from weekly activities and training between games while Madden Ratings Adjustor Chad Johnson guides your career development by providing ratings updates as you strive for the highest level of prestige on your Road to 99. Will your NFL career rank among the all-time greats? It’s up to you.\r\n\r\nFranchise\r\nUtilize refined scouting, staff management, and weekly strategy features to take your Franchise to the top. New athlete motivations like team location and salary demands factor into contract negotiations and add to the drama of NFL free agency. Updated Trade Logic AI represents the value of star players more accurately for fair and more realistic offers.\r\n\r\nMadden Ultimate Team\r\nDevelop your dream roster of current NFL superstars, Hall of Fame legends, and more. Always have something to play for with the first-ever Field Pass challenge and reward tracker in Madden Ultimate Team. Play to earn MUT Champions entry tokens and compete at your convenience. Simplified Set building lets you navigate your content binder more effectively so you can focus on improving your Ultimate Team roster all season.\r\n\r\nThis game includes optional in-game purchases of virtual currency that can be used to acquire virtual in-game items, including a random selection of virtual in-game items.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY.
