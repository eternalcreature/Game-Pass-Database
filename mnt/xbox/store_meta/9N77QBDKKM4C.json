  "description": "Lead the last survivors in the aftermath of the Cataclismo as a corrupted world seeks to destroy all that remains of humanity. Build fortresses brick by brick, designing intricate, towering structures of wood and stone to fend off waves of Horrors as they attempt to overwhelm your band of survivors. Command powerful units in their stalwart defense, coordinating their varied capabilities as you race from breach to breach. Lead forays into the unknown to secure the vital resources needed to grow your military might and construction capabilities as you hold fast against the ever-growing onslaught – siege after siege, night after night.\n\nDESIGN GRAND FORTRESSES\nFar from the relative safety of the Last City, your citadels and outposts hold back the hordes of Horrors before they can strike at the heart of humanity. Build impregnable fortresses across multiple biomes using an intricate building system that allows you to design your defenses with full freedom and strategic creativity, adapting your plans to the surrounding environment. Take advantage of natural chokepoints, height advantages, and local resources as you strategize for the challenge of each upcoming night’s attack.\n\n- A highly modular building system allows you to design your fortresses exactly as you desire – one piece at a time, with blueprints you have designed in advance, or using community creations shared by other players. Use your hard-earned resources to build structures that grant access to previously unreachable parts of the map, or construct fortifications that deny the Horrors access and provide your troops safe vantage points.\n- Build cheaply and quickly using wood, or establish quarries and use durable stone to better withstand the onslaught. Keep an eye on structural integrity and load-bearing columns as falling pieces will kill friend and foe alike, often creating unique opportunities to crush numerous enemies with cleverly placed vulnerabilities.\n- Adapt your fortress to growing needs as you acquire new tools and expand in an attempt to secure all the resources needed to sustain a powerful defensive force. Optimize the path from resource deposits to your warehouses with well placed structures and use rooftop construction to make the most of your limited space.\n\nSTAND AGAINST THE HORDES\nThough the Horrors may test your defenses during the day, only at night do they pour forth in full force. Spend your days exploring the world and pursuing the growth of your fortress, but as the sun starts to set, you would be wise to position your forces in preparation for the night’s onslaught.\n\n- Skillfully command soldiers ranging from sharp-eyed bowmen to explosive cannoneers to respond to an ever-evolving situation as new Horrors emerge. Draw the enemy into chokepoints lined with devastating traps and ambush them raining down fire arrows and pots of poison flung from your battlements. Maneuver your troops into precise tactical positions to take advantage of special traits and abilities made available as they upgrade, positioning them at heights that let them perform at their best – a wise architect can design fortresses that allow for a tiered defense.\n- Build vital structures to sustain your defenses against the growing threat and unlock higher levels of prosperity alongside new technologies. Resource gathering outposts, unit recruitment centers, and housing for your citizens all directly and indirectly support your troops in their efforts. Should the walls falter, even your citizens' homes can be used as a secondary layer of defense – you must protect the citadel at all costs.\n\nMANY WAYS TO PLAY\nCataclismo contains all three of: an epic single-player narrative campaign; a skirmish mode featuring hand-crafted maps; and an endlessly replayable challenge mode that puts you to the test on procedurally generated maps where you fend off increasingly dangerous waves of Horrors. A complex map editor gives you the ability to design and share skirmish maps of your own to challenge the community while the intricate construction system will allow the architecturally inclined to build and share blueprints and help others in their defense against the Horrors.\n\nThe Cataclismo left the world devastated. But all hope is not lost – lead humanity through the darkness to a bright future as you design grand fortresses and command troops in real-time battles against a seemingly endless horde that will stop at nothing to see your people destroyed.",
