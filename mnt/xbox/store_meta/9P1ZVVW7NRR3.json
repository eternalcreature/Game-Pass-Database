  "description": "Scrub in solo or jump into four-player online games in this physics-based surgery sim! With ludicrous co-op play, frantic competitive mode, a campaign with more twists and turns than Bob’s intestines, and a sandbox level builder to create your own theatre of dreams (or nightmares), the possibilities are endless!\r\n\r\nGrab your nearest scalpel (saw, plunge, rubber ducky…) and enter the Bossa Labs Medical Facility, in this 1-4 player physics-based operating theatre of chaos. Bob’s life is in your hand...\r\n\r\nPlay frantically blood-splattered coop games or go solo in Surgeon Simulator 2’s rib-tickling Campaign Mode. Wanting to inject some creativity? Jump into the Creation Mode and build brand new game levels on your own or team up to build something amazing with multiplayer creation tools. From head transplants and leg amputations to dancing games and relay races, at Bossa Labs, you choose your own way to play!\r\n\r\nNothing is ever straightforward including head transplants - who would have known? The Bossa Labs Medical Facility is as much a character in this game as your fellow surgeons and seems to be totally trying to sabotage your surgical career with its labyrinthine corridors, devious puzzles, and tricky traps.\r\n\r\nFrom space stations to discos, bowling alleys to carnivals, your fellow surgeons have been creating some incredible and unlikely scenarios for surgical procedures - and they are all yours to play in with more levels and games being created all the time! Jump in and let the adventure begin…\r\n",
