  "description": "NEW OPERATIVE, NEW THREAT, NEW EPIC CAMPAIGN\nOffering unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth and tactical third-person combat, Sniper Elite: Resistance turns the attention of the award-winning series towards a hidden war, far from the front lines, deep within the heart of occupied France.\nIn a gripping new story that runs parallel with Sniper Elite 5, Harry Hawker, agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), takes the lead for the first time as he discovers an insidious new Wunderwaffe - something so powerful, it guarantees the Nazis will win the war.\nWorking with the French Resistance, this deadly addition to the Reich's arsenal must be eliminated.\nMultiple Kill List targets, and different infiltration and extraction points give you an unequalled choice with how to accomplish objectives and create your own playstyle.\nThe full campaign can also be experienced in co-op. Fight against the Nazi war machine with an ally to share weapons, items and tactical know-how, as well as help each other get back in the fight when you go down during firefights.\n\nVISCERAL X-RAY KILL CAM AND ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS \nThe trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing the true destructive power of every one of your signature shots. Bones deflect bullets to unpredictably rip new paths through enemy bodies and SMGs and pistols also trigger kill cams, showing multiple bullet shots in dramatic slow motion.\nTo land that shot you will need to think like a true sniper. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you zero your sights on the target.\n\nAUTHENTIC WORLD WAR II WEAPONS AND CUSTOMISATION \nThe arsenal at your disposal will feature returning franchise favourites as well as a host of new authentic WWII weapons. Picking your loadout will be key to striking down the Reich’s nefarious plans! \nCustomise your weapon to suit your operating style. Find workbenches scattered around the campaign to customise and upgrade your rifles, secondaries and pistols with new scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Also remember to pick the right ammo for the right job, whether you need armour-piercing shells or a non-lethal takedown.\n\nPROPAGANDA MISSIONS – BE THE RESISTANCE\nLocate unique Propaganda posters across the main campaign and step into the shoes of a French Resistance fighter in all new Propaganda missions. During these scenarios, sneak, snipe and take down enemies to complete time-sensitive objectives and help end the Nazi occupation.\n\nAXIS INVASION MODE\nThe fan-favourite Axis Invasion mode is back! invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Whether you stalk your prey, lay an ambush, or run in guns blazing, the threat of invasion provides a new dimension to the campaign’s challenge. \n\nTENSE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER \nWhen you’ve mastered your rifle, customise your character and loadout as you take the fight online in competitive 16-player battles to earn XP, medals and ribbons.\nIf competition isn’t your style, you can also team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\n",
