  "description": "Harold Halibut is a handmade narrative game about friendship and life on a city-sized spaceship submerged in an alien ocean. \r\n\r\nIt’s been 250 years since your home - an ark-like spaceship - fled an Earth on the verge of cold war to find a habitable planet to preserve the human race.\r\n\r\nYou are Harold, a young lab assistant for the ship’s lead scientist, Jeanne Mareaux. While most of the ship’s inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life lived aboard the sunken ship, Mareaux still works tirelessly to find a way for the ship to leave the planet and find a new, dryer home.\r\n\r\nBut the weird, wonderful and diverse people of the FEDORA I keep Harold busy too… Until one fateful encounter plunges Harold into a world no one could have imagined - and one that may hold the key to Mareaux’s re-launch plans.\r\n\r\nJoin Harold as he explores a vibrant retro-future world in his quest to find the true meaning of ‘home’.",
