  "description": "For years you’ve battled armies and made history your story. Now it’s time to make history once more with a new breakthrough in strategy gaming – introducing Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition now available on Xbox consoles.* \r\n\r\nEnjoy innovative ways to play one of the most beloved strategy games ever with native inputs for Xbox controller, console-specific user interface, and a new tutorial designed for first time players to help achieve easy setup and success. Additionally, if you prefer playing with a keyboard and mouse you can easily plug directly into your console. \r\n\r\nReturn to History – The past is prologue as you are immersed in a rich historical setting of 10 diverse civilizations across the world from the English to the Chinese to the Delhi Sultanate in your quest for victory. Build cities, manage resources, and lead your troops to battle on land and at sea in 4 distinct campaigns with 35 missions that span across 500 years of history from the Dark Ages up to the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Path to Greatness with Historical Figures – Live the adventures of Joan of Arc in her quest to defeat the English, or command mighty Mongol troops as Genghis Khan in his conquest across Asia. The choice is yours – and every decision you make will determine the outcome of history. \r\n\r\nChallenge the World – Jump online to compete, cooperate or spectate with up to 7 of your friends in PVP and PVE multiplayer modes on Xbox One Series X I S and up to 3 friends on Xbox One.  (Online console multiplayer requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Xbox Live Gold, subscriptions sold separately.) \r\n\r\nPlay Custom Games with Mods (Beta) - Play custom skirmish and multiplayer maps, unique mission scenarios, data driven tuning packs and new modes of play for Age of Empires IV. \r\n\r\nAn Age for All Players – Age of Empires IV is an inviting experience for new players with a console-specific tutorial that teaches the essence of real-time strategy and a Campaign Story Mode designed for first time players to help achieve easy setup and success, yet is challenging enough for veteran players with new game mechanics, evolved strategies, and combat techniques.\r\n\r\n*This content is available on Xbox consoles as a free download for current Xbox Game Pass subscribers and owners of Age of Empires IV on PC, excluding Steam purchasers.",
