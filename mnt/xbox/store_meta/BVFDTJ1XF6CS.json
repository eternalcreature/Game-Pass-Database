  "description": "Supports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S and Windows 10/11 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nUpdated and now compatible with Xbox One X. With improved skin tone display through Screen-Space Subsurface Scattering and 4k output, survival horror is taken to the next level.\r\n\r\nEven without a 4K or HDR monitor, the 4k visuals are downscaled and still can be enjoyed through an HD display.\r\n\r\nFear and isolation seep through the walls of an abandoned southern farmhouse. \"7\" marks a new beginning for survival horror with the “Isolated View” of the visceral new first-person perspective. Powered by the RE Engine, horror reaches incredible heights of immersion as players enter a terrifyingly new world of fear as they fight to survive.\r\n\r\nHDR enhanced for richer, more luminous colors.*\r\n*HDR functionality available on Xbox One S with supported games and TVs.",
