Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier-than-ever world.\n\nDayZ is a hardcore open-world survival game with only one rule: stay alive, no matter what. But with a myriad of threats lurking around every corner, that might be easier said than done...\n\n\n\nKey Features:\n\nWith no checkpoints or saves, when you die, you lose everything and have to start over.\nComplex and authentic survival mechanics, including hunting, crafting, building, health preservation, and resource management.\nUnpredictable and often emotional interactions with other players leading to a limitless spectrum of emergent gameplay.\nA huge 230 km2 map with a variety of beautiful landscapes and landmarks based on real-life locations.\nUp to 60 players striving to survive by any means necessary. Make friends, kill on sight, kidnap strangers and bend them to your will, or be betrayed for a can of beans. Anything and everything is possible.\nAn array of environmental threats that will test your capabilities. From erratic weather and dangerous wildlife to pitch-black nights and rage-induced infected.\n\n\nEnter Livonia. Teeming with wildlife, ruins, and hidden locations, Livonia offers 163 km2 of fields, forests, and mysterious landscape - a unique new experience that will appeal to newcomers and DayZ veterans alike.\n\n\n\nExplore the land. An exciting variety of undiscovered locations awaits the brave and adventurous. Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives.\n\n\n\nFollow the bear. Livonia's food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you'll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse.\n\n\n\nDiscover the secret. Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you're with a friend while you look for a way in. And don't forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.",
