A single choice can change the game; remember that thing you did to that guy? Farmer Pepper remembers.  \r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCE FACES\r\n\r\nSmash as many monsters as you can to get some money, spend your savings to buy better weapons and armors from the blacksmith, gear up and get stronger for this journey of smashing even more faces!\r\n\r\nEvery choice you make open up different side quests to obtain powerful weapons and skills or money \r\n\r\nStorm the Castle and slay their bosses before more innocent fall to the mysterious curse that plagues your land.. In the end, only you can rid the land of Upel of these monsters, whichever way you decide to do it; you do you, dude..\r\n\r\nDEUX OR DIE UPDATE\r\n\r\nReturn to the lands of Upel as the Duke Alcedor, this time joined by your trusty squire Cervul as you attempt to regain control from the forces that plague your dutchy. The new mode is playable as a standard 2-player local co-op or as one player hot-swap mode that allows a single person to control both characters by switching on the fly.\r\n\r\nUse Cervul's various tools to bring victory, or ruin, to the land and the people that inhabit it in this newly rebalanced version of the game!",
