It's a dangerous mission, with every encounter presenting a unique challenge with multiple solutions. What will you do if a heavy missile barrage shuts down your shields? Reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape, power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky, or take the fight to them with a boarding party? This \"spaceship simulation roguelike-like\" allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.",
