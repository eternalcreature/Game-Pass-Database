  "description": "Fight. Die. Win! (And probably die some more.) \r\n\r\nNext Up Hero is a dungeon crawler featuring hand-drawn heroes that hack, slash, bongo-drum, boomerang, and jet their way through Ventures. Choose your Hero and start rolling dungeons, gearing out, and maxing your stats. If you're feeling especially heroic, invite a friend for co-op. You're going to need all the help you can get. \r\n\r\nDungeon Maker Mode: Craft a savage dungeon and challenge the community to beat it. If they beat the dungeon, they get to keep a rare piece of loot. If they fail, the treasure is yours. \r\n\r\nPerma-Permadeath: Death is so permanent in Next Up Hero that your “echo” remains for the next player to raise. People die a lot in Next Up Hero, so you can resurrect up to 20 AI followers!\r\n\r\nMixer Interactive Enabled: It’s Hero vs. Dirge powered by Mixer Interactive. Spectators can control the echo army, helping the hero survive the floor, or buff the Dirge enemies, slowing and freezing the player.",
