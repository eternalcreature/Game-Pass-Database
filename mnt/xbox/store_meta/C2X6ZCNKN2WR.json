  "description": "Conan Exiles is an online multiplayer survival game, now with sorcery, set in the lands of Conan the Barbarian. Enter a vast, open-world sandbox and play together with friends and strangers as you build your own home or even a shared city. Survive freezing cold temperatures, explore loot-filled dungeons, develop your character from scavenging survivor to mighty barbarian and powerful sorcerer, and fight to dominate your enemies in epic siege wars.\r\n \r\nConan Exiles can be played in full single-player, co-op, or persistent online multiplayer.\r\n\r\nSURVIVE IN A SAVAGE LAND\r\nDress well or light a campfire to stay warm and make sure to cool yourself down in the heat. Hunt, cook, eat, and drink to stay alive. Build a shelter to weather scouring sandstorms. Be careful when exploring darkened ruins or you might become corrupted by foul sorcery.\r\n\r\nBUILD A HOME AND A KINGDOM\r\nHarvest resources to craft tools and weapons, then build anything from a small home to entire cities piece by piece using a powerful building system. Place traps, elevators, and defenses, then deck out your creations with furniture, crafting stations, and more.\r\n\r\nDOMINATE THE EXILED LANDS\r\nCarve out your piece of the Exiled Lands, taking it from other players if you must! Build siege weapons and use explosives to break down the walls of your enemy’s city. Place traps, recruit thralls, and build defenses to keep your enemies from invading you.\r\n\r\nCORRUPT YOURSELF TO WIELD DARK SORCERY\r\nDiscover insidious sorceries and corrupt your body to wield them. Special perks are awarded to those who give up a portion of their life force. Sacrifice thralls to summon demons and the undead and bend them to your will. Conjure darkness, soar the skies on winged monstrosities, and call down lightning to strike your foes.\r\n\r\nAGES ARRIVE IN THE EXILES LANDS\r\nUpdates in Conan Exiles now come in Ages. Each Age has its own theme, free gameplay updates, and Battle Passes. This model allows us to add features and improvements for free, while providing an easy way for any player to support the game’s growth and receive exclusive themed cosmetics.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE A VAST, OPEN WORLD\r\nJourney through a massive and seamless open world, from the rolling sand dunes of the southern desert to the mysterious eastern swamp and the snow-capped mountains of the frozen north. Climb anywhere and experience full freedom of exploration.\r\n\r\nBRUTAL, BLOODY COMBAT\r\nFight vicious monsters and other players using an action-oriented, combo-based combat system. Dodge, block, and learn to master the true art of combat to become the greatest fighter in the Exiled Lands. Slay using bows, daggers, swords, axes, and more.",
