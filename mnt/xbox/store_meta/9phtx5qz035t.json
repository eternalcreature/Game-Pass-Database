  "description": "Descend into Total Chaos, a gripping survival horror experience that darkens the fragile space between truth and madness.\n\nThe once thriving Fort Oasis feels like a long ago memory; deserted, decayed and too dark for comfort. You’ve wrecked upon its island shore by a sudden storm–its distant past still seems eerily present, but venture inward you must, compelled by cryptic radio transmissions from someone who seems like a friend.\n\nBut as you delve deeper into Fort Oasis reality itself becomes twisted and uncertain as you realize your very existence is at stake.\n\nScavenge for scraps and craft makeshift weapons to defend yourself against the many horrors. Unearth fragments of forgotten lives scattered across the island and piece together the chilling mystery of Fort Oasis’s fate. Each discovery brings you closer to a truth that threatens to shatter your sanity.\n\nKey Features:\n\nImmersive Atmosphere: Explore the nightmarish ruins of Fort Oasis across nine harrowing chapters, each plunging you deeper into its oppressive, decaying world.\n\nEnvironmental Storytelling: Uncover the island’s darkest secrets and confront your own fractured past through cryptic notes, haunting visuals, and unsettling encounters.\n\nCrafting for Survival: Build and upgrade weapons using scavenged materials to stand a chance against the relentless terrors stalking you.\n\nFace Nightmarish Foes: Engage in desperate battles against horrific creatures, each with their own deadly behaviors and strategies.\n\nResource Management: Navigate a deep inventory system where every item matters—your survival hinges on careful choices and quick thinking.",
