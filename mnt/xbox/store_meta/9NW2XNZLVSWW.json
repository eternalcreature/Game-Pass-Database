  "description": "Merge and Blade is a fantasy puzzle game.\r\nYou will engage in large-scale battles with monsters with your own squad which is made using merge mechanics.\r\n\r\nAfter a battle, you can recruit new units using merge mechanics.\r\nBy proceeding with these puzzles and battles, you will retake the castles occupied by monsters.\r\n\r\nAs you retake the castle one by one, your base and squad get stronger.\r\nYour journey will continue until retaking the last castle.\r\n\r\nBut, even if you retake the last castle, your journey won't completely end.\r\n\r\nThere are endless invading monsters that you have to hold off.\r\nYou can battle with your friends or can save the world again with another strategy.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to save this world?\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n◆PUZZLE SYSTEM\r\nThis game is a puzzle that builds blocks that come down like Tetris, Hexa, and Puyo Puyo.\r\nBut it's not about holding out for a long time or removing blocks. it's about merging the same three or more units to create a higher class.\r\n\r\n◆BATTLE SYSTEM\r\nThe goal of the puzzle is to create a squad as strong as possible within a limited turn.\r\nYou can make a much stronger squad or can get additional turns with multi-merge, combo, etc.\r\n\r\nBattles are performed in real-time up to 25 v 25.\r\nIn battles, formation is important, as well as each unit's stats. This is because each unit has its own attack types and attack or heal ranges. \r\nSo it's good to care about the position of the unit when you place units in the puzzle part. In addition, you can use swaps to change their position in battle.\r\n\r\n◆UPGRADE SYSTEM\r\nYou can use gold from puzzles and battles to upgrade your base and units in your squad.\r\nBase upgrades provide unlocking the merging list and adding the number of turns, previews, and swap.\r\nUnits upgrades increase the unit's HP and ATK, giving you an advantage in battles.\r\n\r\n◆DEFENSE MODE\r\nSurvive from the endless monsters as long as you can with your squad you've grown.\r\n\r\n◆VERSUS SYSTEM\r\nBrag your puzzle skill in this local multi-player mode.\r\n\r\n◆CHALLENGE MODE\r\nIt's another land only for the challenge mode. Make a new squad, and complete from start to finish at one go. \r\n\r\n◆ROGUELIKE MODE\r\n",
