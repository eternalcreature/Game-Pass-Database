  "description": "Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Skyrim and Fallout 4, welcome you to Fallout 76. Twenty-five years after the bombs fell, you and your fellow Vault Dwellers—chosen from the nation’s best and brightest – emerge into post-nuclear America on Reclamation Day, 2102. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, build, and triumph against the wasteland’s greatest threats. Explore a vast wasteland, devastated by nuclear war, in this open-world multiplayer addition to the Fallout story. Experience the largest, most dynamic world ever created in the legendary Fallout universe. \n\nReimagine the C.A.M.P. of your dreams with the newly organized workshop menu and relaxed building restrictions. The streamlined workshop menu lets you quickly navigate and filter subcategories and visual variants, while relaxed build rules give you more freedom to place items in the air or on the ground, snap items together with or without collisions, and more. Item locking toggles help prevent you from accidentally dropping or scrapping your favorite weapons, consumables, or items. Balance changes to perks, weapons, and mods create a more consistent combat experience across different playstyles. Plus, during Season 22, browse the Appalachian Modern Living catalog to unlock bespoke items from General Atomics, Nuka-Cola, Sunset Sarsparilla, and more!\n\nImmersive Questlines and Engaging Characters\nUncover the secrets of West Virginia by playing through an immersive main quest, starting from the moment you leave Vault 76. Befriend or betray new neighbors who have come to rebuild, and experience Appalachia through the eyes of its residents.\n\nSeasons\nProgress through each season and unlock free rewards like consumables, C.A.M.P. items and more, by completing limited-time challenges.\n\nMultiplayer Roleplaying\nCreate your character with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and forge your own path and reputation in a new and untamed wasteland with hundreds of locations. Whether you journey alone or with friends, a new and unique Fallout adventure awaits.  \n\nMountain Splendorland \nThe story lives and breathes through the world of Fallout 76, which brings to life six distinct West Virginia regions. From the forests of Appalachia to the noxious crimson expanses of the Cranberry Bog, each area offers its own risks and rewards. \n\nA New American Dream\nUse the all-new Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform (C.A.M.P.) to build and craft anywhere in the world. Your C.A.M.P. will provide much-needed shelter, supplies, and safety. You can even set up shop to trade goods with other survivors.\n\nFallout Worlds\nPlay unique adventures in Appalachia with Fallout Worlds, which is an evolving set of features that give players the capability to play Fallout 76 in unique ways with customizable settings.",
