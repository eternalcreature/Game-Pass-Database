  "description": "This game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nBuild your city into the most powerful of all kingdoms through endless combinations of buildings, units, spells, and positioning. Take advantage of chaotic combos and powerful perks to break the game and become overpowered. Grow your kingdom in strategic ways, prepare for dozens of unique events, and show the world your kingdom can outlast all others.\n\nBUILD YOUR CAPITAL\nFrom humble village to massive citadel, your capital recruits your units and grows their power. Expand your kingdom strategically over time and build it to survive decades of war and strife.\n\nPROTECT YOUR KINGDOM\nFrom sturdy knights and warlocks, to glass cannon wizards and bombers, to hordes of fiendish imps and sentient mushrooms, there are dozens of units to lead and fight. Stockpile gold to hire thousands of mercenaries to your cause, use dark magic to raise the dead, and harness nature itself to bring down your enemies!\n\nCRAFT YOUR DECK\nEach of the kings has a different starting deck of buildings, troops, and spells, but you can loot the rival kings who attack your lands to access cards from their unique decks. Make peace with those whose units don’t fit your playstyle, and declare war against kings with the powers and units you covet, deploying the tools acquired from your enemy to unlock countless combinations of stacking buffs and modifiers to build an invincible army.\n\nRULE YOUR OWN WAY\nCombine your cards in endless ways – try out insane builds and watch massive armies fight for your crown, survive as long as you can against increasingly powerful enemies, or break the game and watch all challengers crumble before you.\n\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://discord.gg/EXEBmsnEAv.",
