  "description": "Take on the role of the Fallen Prince in Unsouled - a stylish, fast-paced 2D action-RPG. Fight your way through interactive environments and adrenaline-pumping encounters as you unravel the mysteries behind this world filled with the undead.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Fast-paced, stylish combat\r\nEnemies in Unsouled react to every move you make. Keep your guard up at all times as the slightest mistake will be met with relentless enemy attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Expert controls and timing\r\nExecute various skill combos and counterattacks for maximum damage. Use the “Abyss” system to get a closer look at the game’s unique mechanics. Players may be tempted to turn down the difficulty settings, but mastering true combat requires practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Chained attacks\r\nEach skill combo in Unsouled have their own unique triggers. Whenever using a skill, your character flashes for a brief second. Use this opportunity to turn your initial strike into a deadly series of blows by performing one skill after another. Learning each skill’s wind-down pattern is crucial to mastering chain attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Counterattacks\r\nCombos aren’t the only tool under your belt. The counterattack mechanics stay true to the high-risk, high-reward principle, allowing you to decimate multiple targets in one seamless attack when done correctly. Mastering the chain-counterattacks is key to turning the tide on your assailants.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Interactive objects\r\nSlamming an enemy against a wall, pushing them off the ledge, cutting a tree down to crush them, or even bringing down a large object to create a makeshift bridge are but a few of many ways to overcome various obstacles and threats in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Passive and Active Souls\r\nYou may come across special Souls as you fight and explore. Passive Souls take effect immediately after being obtained, enhancing abilities, unlocking new skills, or upgrading existing ones. Active Souls are manually activated through button interaction which can unlock skills normally reserved for bosses, and are used for combos as well as escaping from enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Beautiful pixel art\r\n\"Travel across five distinct locations each filled with unique retro style visuals with enemies that are spooky and fun.\r\nEach individual pixel is affected by real-time lighting, meaning, you can enjoy the rich, vibrant pixel graphics in all its glory!\"\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://playneowiz.com/unsouled.",
