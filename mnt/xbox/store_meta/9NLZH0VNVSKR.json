  "description": "PURE SURVIVAL HORROR\nResources are scarce, your enemies are numerous, and you never know when you’ll find more weapons, ammo, first aid, or food. How you allocate the resources determines if you live or die.\n\nWITH PERMADEATH, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE\nSurvival is not guaranteed. Once you die, your character joins the horde of undead shambling through London. You’ll come back as an entirely new character and try to survive, again.\n\nBUG-OUT BAG\nYour bug-out bag holds all your tools, inventory, first aid kits, maps, and more. Don’t get distracted, as zombies can attack you at any moment. If you die, your bag stays with your old character, who is now a zombie. Will you risk it all to get your bag back, or start scavenging anew?",
