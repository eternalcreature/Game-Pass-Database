  "description": "ABOUT THIS GAME\r\n\r\nWelcome to Myst: a starkly beautiful island, eerily tinged with mystery and shrouded in intrigue.\r\n\r\nJourney to Myst Island and other stunning, long dormant locations - called “Ages”- and begin to unravel the mystery you have been thrust into. As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself.\r\n\r\nCyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst.\r\n\r\nBuilt from the ground up, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated modern Myst experience has arrived!\r\n\r\nNEW AND REQUESTED FEATURES\r\n\r\nFor the first time in Myst’s history, enjoy the game in many different languages through localized UI, including dialogue and gameplay-context subtitles.\r\n\r\n- A variety of accessibility options to assist in gameplay.\r\n- A large number of graphics options to choose from, such as supersampling options and Ray Tracing to bring the best Myst experience out of the hardware you have.\r\n\r\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nQ: I bought Myst when it first came out in 1993. Can I get a free upgrade to this new version?\r\nA: Thank you for your support over the years! We are not giving out free upgrades to previous purchasers of the original Myst. We put a lot of effort into making this new version of Myst and would appreciate your financial support again!\r\n\r\nQ: Does this version of Myst support VR?\r\nA: This version of Myst does not support VR, as the platform itself does not support it.\r\n\r\nQ: I want to play Myst, but am concerned about my computer not meeting the minimum requirements. What should I do?\r\nA: If your machine does not meet the minimum requirements and you still want to try Myst out, we recommend enabling one of our supersampling options through the graphics settings menu to see if it alleviates performance concerns. Depending on the storefront you purchase Myst from, you may be able to qualify for a refund through the store (not through Cyan support) if Myst does not run well on your platform. Please review each store platform refund policy for details.\r\n\r\nQ: Will Myst support [insert language here] one day?\r\nA: Possibly! We’d love to hear from you through our support team about any languages you’d like for us to support.",
