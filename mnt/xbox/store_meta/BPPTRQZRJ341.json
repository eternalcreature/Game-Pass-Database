  "description": "In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth’s surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival; with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside.\r\n\r\nYou are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. \r\n\r\nYour journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut what if the real threat comes from within?\r\n\r\n• Immerse yourself in the Moscow Metro – witness one of the most atmospheric worlds in gaming brought to life with stunning next-gen visuals at 60FPS\r\n\r\n• Brave the horrors of the Russian apocalypse – equip your gasmask and an arsenal of hand-made weaponry as you face the threat of deadly mutants, human foes, and the terrifying environment itself \r\n\r\n• Rebuilt and Remastered for next gen – this is no mere ‘HD port’. Metro 2033 has been rebuilt in the vastly improved Last Light engine and gameplay framework, to create the definitive version of the cult classic that fans and newcomers alike can enjoy\r\n\r\n• Two unique Play Styles : ‘Spartan’ and ‘Survival’ – approach the campaign as a slow burn Survival Horror , or tackle it with the combat skills of a Spartan Ranger in these two unique modes \r\n\r\n• The legendary Ranger Mode returns – dare you play the fearsome Ranger Mode? No HUD, UI, deadlier combat and  limited resources combine to create the ultimate immersive experience\r\n\r\nBased on the internationally bestselling novel series by Dmitry Glukhovsky.",
