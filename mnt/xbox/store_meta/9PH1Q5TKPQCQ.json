  "description": "An unexpected hero emerges on the city's darkest night. \r\n\r\nYou’re Babyface, a former member of the criminal underworld lured back into “the life” by a mysterious AI drone. Your mission against impossible odds: Fight your way across the city before sunrise, and prevent a citywide criminal takeover together.\r\n\r\nEngage in a brutal and hyper-kinetic brawling ballet, using every environmental tool and street fighting technique at your disposal. Level up your abilities to take down the mounting onslaught of bozos, cronies, and crime lords.\r\n\r\nBlockbuster Combat\r\nTangle with waves of foes with the finesse of an action-movie master. Punch, dodge, counter, and finish off enemies in fluid and visceral combat featuring mo-cap animation by motion artist and stunt performer Eric Jacobus. Custom difficulty modes allow any player to direct the action to their preference.\r\n\r\nMartial Mastery\r\nLevel up, power up, and tap into a sprawling skill tree to unleash a dizzying array of devastating fighting moves. Develop your own signature style, and master over-the-top combos that leave the criminals wondering what hit ’em. \r\n\r\nKiller Arsenal\r\nComplement your melee moves with knives, axes, and sledgehammers. Wield a wild array of pistol fire, shotgun blasts, and explosives. Weaponize everything from furniture to toilet plungers. Take advantage of the urban world around you to score increasingly outrageous takedowns and clean up the streets.\r\n\r\nStreet Warrior’s Wardrobe \r\nCustomize your character’s appearance, and unlock a huge variety of cosmetic options ranging from the ultra-suave to the mega-outlandish. Unlock more 150+ pieces of clothing, equip skins for you and your AI ally Droney, and make a lasting impression as you fight to save the streets.\r\n\r\nAudio Adrenaline Rush\r\nBattle across the city’s 41 hand-crafted levels to the beat of a pulsing, infectious soundtrack by artist Noisecream, and channel the nonstop midnight energy of the metropolis. \r\n\r\nThe Fight Never Stops\r\nReturn to missions to complete challenges, unlock rewards, and show everyone who owns the streets on the leaderboard. Create your own director’s cut of the action with settings that let you customize enemy types, weapons, and more. \r\n",
