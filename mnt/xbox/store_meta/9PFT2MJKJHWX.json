Untangling an afterlife is no easy feat, especially when you don’t have feet!\n\nKulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a papercraft adventure game where you’ll meet the many good and not-so-good folks of Limbo, a place where souls with deep regrets are cursed into repeating the same day on a loop. \n\nUse your wits and keen eye to gather clues from the residents and find items that will help you to breach the obstacles in your path one by one.\n\nYou play as Kulebra, a dead snake with a heart of gold that wakes up in Limbo. With his only lead being the words of a strange Old Lady, he embarks on a quest to find his purpose while sharing his light with the residents in hopes of helping them as well.\n\n- Explore and interact with the world to gather clues and items that will help you open doors in your quest (figuratively and literally).\n- A game that will reward you for interacting with the world, paying attention to details, and connecting the dots.\n- Full of characters with their own quirks, side stories, and schedules that bring life to this world despite most of them being very dead.\n- An in-game day, dusk, and night cycle that will change the world and characters, ending with the curse that resets the souls of Limbo back to the start.\n- A notebook will keep track of important details for you, so you can't blame me if you weren't paying attention.\n- Confront the dark souls attempting to put out your light; Overcome their challenges that will test everything you’ve learned C10in this journey.\n- Bilingual!
