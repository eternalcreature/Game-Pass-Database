Assemble into a team of up to four players online, master extraordinary abilities, customize an expansive roster of Heroes, and defend the Earth from escalating threats.\r\n\r\nMarvel’s Avengers begins at A-Day, where Captain America, Iron Man, the Hulk, Black Widow, and Thor are unveiling a new, hi-tech Avengers Headquarters in San Francisco. The celebration turns deadly when a mysterious enemy causes a catastrophic accident which results in massive devastation. Blamed for the tragedy, the Avengers disband.
