  "description": "The sequel to the party game phenomenon The Jackbox Party Pack, featuring FIVE fresh, rib-tickling party games! Games include: \n1) The runaway hit bluffing game Fibbage 2 (2-8 players) with over 500 brand-new questions, more than 2x the original. \n2) The hear-larious sound-effects game Earwax (3-8 players). \n3) The absurd art auction game Bidiots (3-6 players), where you draw right there on your phone or tablet. \n4) The say-anything, gut-busting Quiplash XL (3-8 players), which includes everything in Quiplash, Quip Pack 1, AND over 100 brand-new prompts. \n5) The bomb-defusing nailbiter of a party game, Bomb Corp. (1-4 players). \nPlayers play using their phones, tablets, or even computers as controllers – making it the perfect easy-to-join party starter. No extra controllers needed! And, spectators can join and affect some games by playing as Audience members! \n\nNOTE: This game is local play, but can be enjoyed over streams with remote players. It’s a game-night riot in a box… without the box!\n\nNOTE: The games included in this pack are in English only.",
