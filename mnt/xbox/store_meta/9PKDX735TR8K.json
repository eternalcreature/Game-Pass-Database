  "description": "Raid dungeons, earn sweet loot and save the day – that’s what adventurers do, and it’s your job to stop them! Become a ruthless dungeon keeper and defend your precious subterranean fortress from do-gooders at all costs. This is your dungeon, and the only one who gets to raid it is you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet creative with your calamity. There’s lots of ways to deal with hapless heroes, each more fiendishly fun than the last. Build labyrinths, set traps, unleash hordes of dastardly demons and do whatever it takes to kick those heroes to the curb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule your way. Keep your minions well-supplied with bustling infrastructure and good pay, or scare them into miserable servitude. There’s no extra credit for good behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBring your friends to their knees. Play with up to four frenemies and prove who’s the most ruthless dungeon keeper in all land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY. SEE EA.COM/LEGAL FOR DETAILS.",
