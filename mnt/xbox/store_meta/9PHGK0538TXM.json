  "description": "WHAT WORLD WILL YOU MAKE?\n\nWelcome to a vast, social sandbox MMO inspired by the legends of the medieval era. Here, myths are real, ghosts exist, and magic is unquestioned. Join thousands of players as you explore the land, build your home, forge your reputation, and craft your own stories. \n\nIncludes:\n- Game access\n- 2x Character Slots\n- Free: 1 month of Premium Membership (1 plot)*\n\nA PLACE TO CALL HOME\n\nTravel the relative safety of the Heartlands and find the perfect plot of land on which to build your home. Protected by the grace of the Divine, your village is a safe harbor where your Clan can grow and prosper.\n\nEverything in this world is produced by the players' hands and skills. Your village needs clothes, walls, food, flowers, and prayers. Your Clan, weapons, and armor. Others require tools, materials, or mysterious reagents. It’s easy to find your place and play your part in this breathing world.\n\nEXPLORE UNCHARTED LANDS\n\nAdventure awaits as you set foot into the Wilderness. Here, you’ll battle evil beings, uncover mysteries of an ancient and wondrous past, and square off against rival Clans as you struggle for power, position, and resources.\n\nA word of warning: The further you journey from home, the stranger and more dangerous this world becomes. The glory, bounty, and secrets you bring back will enrich your entire Clan. How much challenge are you willing to accept? That’s for you to decide.\n\nEVERYONE MATTERS\n\nSkinning a basilisk, choosing between war and peace, picking flowers: it all matters. In a fully player-driven world, all play styles connect and complement each other. Join the community and be part of the stories about to take shape.\n\n*Premium Membership grants additional bonuses. Premium membership is not required to play Pax Dei. Additional fees may apply. ",
