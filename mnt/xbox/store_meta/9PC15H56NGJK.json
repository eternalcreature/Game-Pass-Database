  "description": "HALLOWEEN UPDATE\r\nThis very special update brings a bunch of NEW FEATURES to Amnesia: The Bunker, really switching up the gameplay, adding new horrors and heaps of replay value.\r\n\r\nNote: Most of these are New Game+ features and are only accessible by completing the game on any difficulty once.\r\n\r\nAmnesia: The Bunker is a first-person horror game from the makers of SOMA and Amnesia.\r\n\r\nLeft all alone in a desolate WW1 bunker with only one bullet remaining in the barrel, it’s up to you to face the oppressing terrors in the dark. Keep the lights on at all costs, persevere, and make your way out alive. A truly intense horror experience.\r\n\r\nRising tension\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself in the multiple ways of tackling survival. In the shoes of the French soldier Henri Clément, you are armed with a revolver gun, a noisy dynamo flashlight, and other scarce supplies to scavenge and craft along the way. With randomization and unpredictable behavior, no play-through is the same.\r\n\r\nHunted by an ever-present threat reacting to your every move and sound, you must adapt your play-style to face hell. Every decision will change the outcome of how the game responds. Actions bear consequences.\r\n\r\nEscaping the nightmare\r\n\r\nSolve things your own way in a semi-open world. You must explore and experiment to make your way out. Figure out what’s going on down here - what has happened to the other soldiers? Where have all the officers gone? What diabolical nightmare lurks underneath this hellscape? Unravel the mysteries of the Bunker and get to know the nooks and crannies of this cruel sandbox to up your odds of survival.",
