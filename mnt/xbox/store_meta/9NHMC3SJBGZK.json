  "description": "Experience the newest version of SimCity - the greatest city-simulator of all time. This collection is packed with an expanded core game, the SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow expansion pack, and the Amusement Park, Airship, French, British and German City sets. Create the city you desire and make choices that will shape your city and the Sims in it. Focus on industry, or consumerism and your economy will soar – but at the expense of your Sims' health as pollution spreads. Implement green technology and improve your Sims’ lives while risking higher taxes and unemployment. The choice is yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay Offline or Online: The choice is yours. Play anytime, anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepth of Simulation: Unprecedented depth of simulation, where everything you see is simulated even down to each individual Sim in your city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecialize in What You Love: Mold your city as a casino resort, a manufacturing hub, a haven for thrill seekers, a consumer-driven mega-corporation, a green utopia, and more. Then watch as a unique look and feel spreads throughout your city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild into the Sky: Create even denser cities by building upward with towering multi-zone MegaTowers that allow your Sims to live, work, and play without ever having to touch the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Multi-city Scale: Play a single city or up to 16 cities at once and track population, wealth, education and happiness across your region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete SimCity box set: Includes the expanded core game, the SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow expansion pack, plus five digital content sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY.
