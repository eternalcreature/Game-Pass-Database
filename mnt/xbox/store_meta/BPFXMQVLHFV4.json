With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows the escapades of Dr. Jones through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favourite cinematic moments, from Indyâ€™s entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run. Additionally, players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes in more than 18 different levels that mirror the classic films.",
