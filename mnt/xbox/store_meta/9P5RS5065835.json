  "description": "Dig into the biggest smallest adventure\r\n\r\nUnearth what’s beneath the surface in Six Inches Under, a new first-person Supraland adventure full of puzzles, exploration, fun secrets to discover, hundreds of gags, and two funny ones!\r\n\r\nIn the miniature world, the dreaded Rakening has scattered the townspeople of Superland six whole inches below the surface of the sandbox! Fulfill your toybox fantasies as a brave Blue Plumber and use your skill and ingenuity to survive and rescue your fellows. You may be small—but this is bound to be one big adventure.\r\n\r\nUnderworld exploration\r\nUnearth a connected underworld of toys who’ve survived past calamities. The caverns are filled with secrets to discover and new areas to uncover—once you’ve acquired the right tools and abilities to access them.\r\n\r\nFirst-person puzzling\r\nSolve problems in the environment with brains (and occasional brawn). Use skillful platforming to find secrets and hard to reach areas, and harness the power of physics to find creative ways to overcome obstacles. \r\n\r\nIt’s a small world\r\nFor the people of Supraland, little things make a big difference. Turn a matchstick into the lever that opens a door or a torch that ignites an obstacle. Power mighty machines with the latest AAA battery technology, cross cracks the size of chasms, and walk (literally!) on the razor’s edge. \r\n\r\nA great place to dig in\r\nSix Inches Under is a content-packed standalone follow-up (and not quite a sequel) to the original Supraland, designed for everyone! You can delve straight in and have a blast without having played the original.\r\n\r\nMore Supraland to love\r\nIf you dug the original Supraland, you’ll discover tons more of the puzzle-solving, metroidvania-style exploration you loved—plus more skills, a novel new approach to combat, more optional activities, and an original new soundtrack.\r\n",
